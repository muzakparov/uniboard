Today, students are receiving those scores.</p>
<p>In this interview with Jack Buckley, College Board's senior vice president for research, All Access delves deeper into the research that informed this decision and explores the “how and why” behind our ability to provide reliable scores for students.</p>
<p><strong>What exactly happened with the June 6 SAT forms?                                          </strong></p>
<p>A printing error in students’ SAT test books incorrectly indicated that they had 25 minutes to complete the last reading section, while the test center supervisors’ manual indicated the <em>correct</em> time of 20 minutes. So, some students thought they had five extra minutes to complete the section than they actually did.</p>
<p>Because of the way the SAT is administered, students taking the last math section in the same room at the same time would also be affected, even though the misprint only appeared in the last reading section.</p>
<p>Together with ETS, we conducted an extensive analysis to decide how to resolve the issue in a way that was respectful to students and families and psychometrically sound. Our analysis found that not scoring the two impacted sections would still allow us to produce scores that are sufficiently reliable for use by colleges and other organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Can you describe how you conducted the analysis?</strong></p>
<p>Our analysis focused on three key considerations:</p>
<ol><li>Whether the scores would be sufficiently reliable when not scoring two sections.</li><li>Whether we could equate the test forms if we did not score two sections.</li><li>Whether the remaining sections include the same distribution of content and skills that would allow students to demonstrate their ability.</li></ol><p><strong>What does “reliable scores” really mean?</strong></p>
<p>“Reliability” is the tendency of scores to be consistent on different testing occasions when the student’s ability is unchanged. Since tests like the SAT are well-understood statistically, we were able to model the effect of a shorter test (i.e., a test missing a section) on reliability.</p>
<p>We found that the reliability of the shortened June 6 SAT was comparable to that of the full-length test.</p>
<p><strong>So, why not just shorten the exam for good?</strong></p>
<p>A good test design necessitates building in a certain level of redundancy to provide reliable results even if things don’t go as planned. For example, if a test item or set of items doesn’t perform as expected, it can be omitted and the test can still provide reliable results. This doesn’t occur often, but the SAT is built to withstand it nonetheless.</p>
<p><strong>What about the other two considerations? How did you determine whether the shortened test could be equated, and whether it included the right distribution of content and skills?</strong></p>
<p>“Equating” is a statistical procedure that is conducted to ensure that different versions of a test are of comparable difficulty. The SAT is equated using anchor sections — sections that have appeared on previous forms and are used to put the new form “on scale.” During the June 2015 administration, the anchor sections were not affected by the printing error, and therefore neither was the equating process.</p>
<p>While reliability and equating are essential, it is equally important to ensure that the content of the shortened test adequately represents the intended domain of knowledge and skills. We compared the content and item parameters (item difficulty and the ability to distinguish between test-takers based on their level of knowledge) in the correctly timed sections to the overall test specifications.</p>
<p>Since each SAT section is designed to reflect the overall distribution, we found that this shortened test is highly aligned to the overall SAT content specifications.</p>
<p><strong>How can students know that their scores reflect those they would have received if all sections had been scored?</strong></p>
<p>By examining reliability, fairness, and the coverage of content and skills, we determined that the June 6 SAT had very similar properties to the typical SAT. As such, students’ scores are a valid and reliable representation of their knowledge, abilities, and skills across the content domains assessed by the SAT.</p>
<p><strong>Will colleges still accept the scores from June 6? </strong></p>
<p>We have talked with college admission directors from across the country, and they have expressed full confidence in the scores and will use them as they would any other SAT score in their admission decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks, Jack!</strong></p>

    Thanks for linking College Board's update.

"Second, the equating process was not affected by the error. Equating is a statistical procedure that is conducted to ensure that different versions of a test are of comparable difficulty."

Does this mean that the curves were not modified to account for the fewer questions? What I mean is the following: pretend a test taker missed two math questions. He/she would usually get a 760. But, with only 38 questions instead of 54 questions, many believed that the score would be more like a 740 on the June 6 SAT. Either it means that, or if you missed two they extrapolated it to minus three, thus producing a lower score.
Thoughts?      </div>

    My name is David Siqueiros and my daughter Rebecca Siqueiros took the SAT on June 6, 2015 in Miami, Florida.

As I understand it you will provide a new testing date in October 2015 considering your June 6, 2015 test was deficient.

October is too late to retest for those interested in early decision deadlines of November 2015. You should provide a new test date much earlier.

Please consider the amount of extra time students study for the SAT in addition to regular school classes and extracurricular activities including community service activities.

Again you should provide an optional testing day well before October 2015 specifically for those affected by your clerical mistake of June 6, 2015.

I am sure your mistakes were not intentional but you did make a mistake. With this in mind the best course of action will be to benefit those affected by taking action above and beyond what you are proposing.

Please schedule a new test before October 2015 because this date is not conducive to those who were affected by your mistakes of June 6, 2015 and create additional expenses, stress and anxieties for those who were affected by your mistakes.      </div>

    David Siqueiros is 100% correct.  We work hard to teach our children to own up to their mistakes and to make things right.  The College Board should set a good example for these students and provide an exam in late July so that the students can have their scores before they spend countless hours preparing college applications, researching schools, etc.  October 3 is far too late for many students who intend to have their applications completed prior to that date.  Many schools have strict deadlines when it comes to providing merit scholarships, and by not retaking the exam until October 3 thousands and thousands of students will not know truly where they stand in relation to acceptance and scholarships.  Not to mention that any of the study skills, etc. that the students used for the June exam will be ancient history by October.  This means many more study hours for the students plus the potential for a lot of money to be paid to tutors as there will be a lot of stress for this final opportunity to take the exam for the class of 2016.  SHAME ON YOU COLLEGE BOARD!!! DO THE RIGHT THING AND PROVIDE AN EXAM WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.  This is way too important to ignore or to hide behind the desire for more financial profit.  Your video is ridiculous.  I will NEVER EVER believe that my daughter's June scores were correct and I will NEVER EVER trust your organization again.  SHAME ON YOU!  You are the gateway to college for America's youth and you have FAILED.  The powers that be at the college board ought to beware of karma. Here's hoping that it kicks you hard in the tail.      </div>

    Shame on you College Board.  We work hard to raise our children to be honest and to have integrity and to own up to their mistakes.  Yet the supreme organization at the gateway to most colleges in the US has royally messed up and claims that it had no effect on scores.  THAT IS NONSENSE AND A LIE.  This is an outright attempt to cloud over your error and to escape culpability.  You should do the right thing and provide a free SAT in late July so that students have the chance to try again and to know their scores PRIOR to applying to colleges.  October 3 is FAR TOO LATE.  First of all, scores will not be available until almost the application deadline for many schools offering scholarships.  Not to mention that students will be forced to pay application fees and to work hard on applications for schools to which they may not have applied had they known their true scores.  I will NEVER EVER BELIEVE THAT THE JUNE 6 SCORES ARE CORRECT.  SHAME SHAME SHAME.  For once please forget the bottom line and do the right thing and give these kids a chance to take this exam in the next few weeks.  Make things right.  If you don't, good luck because karma can be a you-know-what.      </div>

    I agree with the post by David Siqueiros post. My daughter Emily took the test on June 6 in Savannah, GA.

My daughter will be applying to several schools for early decision and the October date will be too late.  There needs to be an additional SAT date set up for the students who have taken the June 6 test.  These students study hard and are very stressed about the test. as well as their rigorous classes.  You made the error.  I don't believe that there is any way you can be sure that these scores are accurate, even with the data and professionals.  How is it fair to count only 2 sections on this test date and three on all other tests?  This is not fair to these students.   I am stunned by the decision that you all have made.  This is definitely not in the best interest of the students. There needs to be a make up date for these students ASAP.  Please schedule a test date for these students before the September test date.      </div>

    You have college educated people dispensing these test and no one checked the booklets for any Errors.  This just shows how getting the money to take these test are more important then giving the tests.   I am going to start a petition with all the families effected to get a new test given under the supervision of someone who knows what they are doing.  This test will be administered without any fee's to the families / students otherwise I am going to start a class action lawsuit showing that the College Board acted reckless and should pay back what has been paid plus damages.        </div>

    I demand a retake test to be offered THIS SUMMER, free of charge, to all those who took the June 6 SAT. An October retake is far too late for those students applying early decision, those applying to special competitive programs which have accelerated deadlines, and those counting on merit based scholarships.  You have created an unfair bias for those students who need to rely upon merit scholarships to be able to afford college and those who don't get fee waivers, grants from the federal government to attend college, or sports scholarships.
The flip and casual manner of the College Board in the handling of this matter in inexcusable.  I'm certain it is to deflect an onslaught of bad publicity.  Well I have news for you college board, you are a monopoly shrouded in "not for profit" clothing, whose executives command salaries in the six figures.  It is downright cowardly for the College Board to blame the error on the company that does the printing for the exam.  The buck stops with YOU, college board.  It is ultimately your responsibility to ensure that your documents are accurate.  For you to state that colleges admissions officers have full faith in the scores reported, what choice do they have?  You are the only game in town.        </div>

    The error made by college board is completely unacceptable and recourse suggested by college board even more egregious. This shoddy approach to justify the gross error mocks the efforts and hard work students have put in over several months at a critical time for college application. Not counting 2 sections and applying scores of prior section CANNOT represent the true score at all. It is imperative that College board offer a retest in July or early August for the students who took June 6 SAT.  This option, although a significant challenge and interruption in the life of large number students and families, is better than being stuck with an erroneous test and extrapolated results or working through entire summer to take the another attempt in October. This gross error certainly has significantly affected the college boards credibility with students, parents and colleges regardless of what Jack says they have heard from colleges. Only fair option is offer a retest in immediate term. College board must take responsibility for this horrendous mistake and what it has done to students, and remedy themselves by offering a timely and completely fresh test. No other option is acceptable. Students must be given an option to not count this test as one of the attempts. 
The autocratic, unilateral approach to force students to accept college boards subjective justification can not be allowed to be stand. College board must do the right thing by offering another test as soon as possible. Time is of essence. College board TAKE ACTION NOW!      </div>

    It appears THE alternative to get the College Boards ear, according to their singular response on this comment thread, is to communicate via e-mail at: sat@info.collegeboard.org.

Has anyone had better luck receiving useful information from the college board?

My recommendation for the College board is to over deliver in customer service for the students who took the exam June 6th--they know exactly who they are. This is their best shot at maintaining some credibility, not being sued, and ultimately not being put out of business . . .

Between Khan stepping up to help prepare and a POTUS anxious to take over many things around education (loans anyone?) I submit the College Board work to shine on this issue very soon. 

My daughter is doubting her score even though she studied very hard and saw her numbers go up quite significantly. She doesn't need her confidence challenged after such monumental efforts and achievement!      </div>

    Has there been any feedback to our concerns from Collge Board?  I wrote and called and am still waiting for resolution.  I can without a doubt state that taking 16 math questions and 19 reading questions all level 2, 3, 4, hurt our rising senior's score by at least 50 points. I was told "sorry for the inconvenience"....which is not what I needed to hear.  Sounds like we need legal representation to get a reply?  That's my next step!

    I just called the College Board Customer Support to find out how the June 6 SAT was scored with the 2 missing sections. I took that test and I got less questions wrong on my Math section but received a lower score than my March 14 Test! The woman assisting me kept offering me this hand done verification for $55 that would have someone regrade my Multiple Choice by hand. I did some research and it turns out that most people get a LOWER score after the regrade. I am extremely displeased that my admission into my college of choice is potentially harmed by this ridiculous debacle. If the College Board is truly the organization it claims to be, it would provide a detailed publicly accessible explanation as to how the test was  scored using 7 section instead of 9.      </div>

    I think that what has happened to these students is a disgrace in the College Board's  ability to administer a test to these students whom have a lot riding on their scores.  For the rising seniors to receive the best offers from the colleges they needed these scores to be accurate.  For the seniors whom graduated this year and whom were trying to obtain a higher score for state funding, in our case bright futures, the college board has let these young adults down.  You have caused financial hardship for many families as these students whom graduated this year do not have another chance to retake the test whether it be in October or sooner as they will be starting classes at their Universities in August and in order for test scores to count at the Universities and at the State level, they need to be submitted to the college no later than July 31, 2015.  What I would like to know is how many students have been effected by this mistake that the college board has made as far as not qualifying for the state funds to help pay for their education due to their score not meeting the states requirements.  These students have spent numerous hours studying for the SAT not to mention completing their everyday school assignments, Community Service and Athletics and for the College Board to make a decision to not count the last 2 sections of the test and say that it does not effect their score is an outright lie.  I propose that we the parents of these students seek legal counsel for 2 different avenues the first being the seniors whom have graduated and have lost thousands of dollars through their state programs due to not meeting the requirements and secondly for the rising seniors whom will most likely loose out on the first round of monies that the universities give out based on their scores as so many of the parents have said by waiting to take the test again in October it will be too late as many students already have their applications submitted by the first of October.  I can tell you that my son missed out on thousands of dollars from the state of Florida through the Bright Futures program over 20 points and I think most of you will agree as so many other parents/students have stated that by the College Board not scoring the last 2 tests has had or will have a substantial monetary effect on many of these students ability to go to the college of their dreams not to mention the hardship that it is going to put on families as they do what they can to send their children to the college to obtain a degree in the field that they want to work in.  To ask these kids to work hard everyday, study, stay focused, keep your grades and GPA up and give back to your community in the way of volunteer hours as it will all pay off when you graduate and move on to college and then for a large organization such as the College Board to take that away from them by making the decision not to count two of the test instead of either having them retake the test the next week or simply just counting all of the questions, seeing how it was your fault, is a disgrace and the hours that parents spend teaching their kids that nothing is handed to you you have to work hard and it will pay off was for what....NOTHING.....as many of these students now have to obtain loans to pay for their education even though they have busted their a_ _ _ _ for 4 years studying, volunteering to be told oh I am sorry we are not going to do right by you is completely unacceptable and I know that this is not the end of this for our family.  Many of us parents tell our kids "you are held accountable for your actions" well College Board you are no different you too must be held accountable for your actions and for the hardship that you have caused hundreds of students and their families.

    Why can't a retest be given earlier than October 3rd??  I have seen this question asked by several parents & yet not one comment from anybody at College Board!!  This does negatively affect students with a delay in early academic admittance, scholarship money and even the possibility of not getting into a major of their choice due to delayed acceptance with the competitive universities.
