Nature and Purpose of the College Board</h3><p>A. The College Board is a membership corporation chartered by the New York Board of Regents under the New York Education Law. The members of the Corporation are institutions, systems, organizations, and agencies engaged in or serving postsecondary/higher or secondary education and working together to support preparation for and transitions to postsecondary/higher education.</p><p>B. The purpose of the College Board is to develop and coordinate activities related to student academic preparation, admission, financial aid, and success in postsecondary/higher education. In carrying out these activities the College Board is committed to access and equity for all students.</p><h3>II. Membership</h3><p>A. The Board of Trustees shall establish a Committee on Membership to deal with issues relating to membership and shall authorize the Committee to interpret and apply the criteria of eligibility for membership set forth in this Article.</p><p>B. There is a single category of membership called "member."</p><p>C. It is the responsibility of College Board members to maintain policies and practices that create and support equitable access to admission, receipt of financial aid, and continuing enrollment for all students. The faithful discharge of this responsibility is a condition of initial and continuing membership, and is subject only to the right of an educational institution to define its mission in terms of educating persons of the same gender or of a particular religious faith as long as all persons of that gender or particular religious faith are dealt with in an equitable manner.</p><p>D. With regard to paragraph C., of this Article, the non-discrimination clause, the Committee on Membership shall publish, with the approval of the Board of Trustees, their interpretation of this paragraph on a regular basis. As a condition of membership, members must comply with the interpretation of the nondiscrimination clause as approved by the Board of Trustees.</p><p>E. New members shall be elected on application to the President and recommendation of the Board of Trustees by a majority vote of the members at a meeting.</p><p>F. To be eligible for election:</p><p>1. Secondary and postsecondary schools and institutions must be appropriately accredited and make regular and substantial use of one or more College Board programs and services.</p><p>2. Secondary and postsecondary systems of substantial size must have demonstrated an interest in and support for the work of the College Board. They must contain within the system institutions eligible for membership in the College Board and permit individual institutions within the system to be members of the College Board.</p><p>3. Non-profit educational associations, organizations, and agencies serving postsecondary/higher and secondary education, must be engaged in activity in furtherance of education that has a special relevance to the purposes of the College Board.</p><p>G. The membership of any member may be terminated at any time by the submission of its resignation in writing to the President. Membership may be terminated at any time by the Board of Trustees and shall terminate automatically if the conditions of eligibility for membership cease to exist.</p><h3>III. Voting of Members and Delegates</h3><p>A. On issues that are submitted to a vote of the members of the College Board, each member is entitled to one vote.</p><p>B. Any reference in these Bylaws to a majority vote or a percentage vote of the members of the College Board shall mean a vote by a majority or such percentage, as the case may be, of the votes duly cast at a meeting of the College Board or, when a vote is taken by mail ballot, of the votes duly cast by such ballot.</p><p>C. On issues that are submitted to a vote of the delegates of the members of the College Board, each delegate is entitled to one vote. In all elections of individuals, the vote shall be by delegates.</p><h3>IV. Delegates</h3><p>A. Each member shall appoint up to three persons to participate on behalf of the member in the governance and forums of the College Board and to receive membership mailings and publications. The persons so appointed shall represent the member in meetings of the Corporation, and of the Regional Assemblies, and one of such persons shall be designated to represent the member in each of the National Assemblies. Alternates to act in the absence or incapacity of delegates may also be appointed.</p><p>B. Each member shall designate its delegates by written notice to the Secretary of the Corporation.</p><p>C. The vote of a member shall be cast by its delegates, whether the vote is taken at a meeting or by mail ballot. To cast a vote at a meeting, a delegate must be present. No delegate shall represent more than one member or cast more than one vote.</p><p>D. The members may at any meeting elect delegates at large for a term of three years and honorary delegates at large for an unlimited term. Such delegates shall have all the privileges of other delegates except the right to vote.</p><h3>V. Regional Assemblies</h3><p>A. There shall be six Regional Assemblies of the College Board—New England, Middle States, Midwest, South, Southwest, and West—composed of delegates of all the members of the College Board located in the geographical areas specified for each Assembly in each of their governance plans. The location of an educational association or organization shall be determined for this purpose by the geographical location of a duly designated delegate. A member not located within the area of a Regional Assembly shall be assigned to one of the Assemblies by the Board of Trustees.</p><p>B.
