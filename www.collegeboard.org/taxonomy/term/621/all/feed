The Academic Assembly is charged with considering issues and actions related to providing universal access to high standards of learning. During the AAC’s most recent meeting, the council discussed several important issues and programmatic developments, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The role of professional development at the College Board&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The development of a high-quality, innovative program at the College Board that supports rigorous instructional opportunities for students in grades 6–12&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communications around the redesigned SAT&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Member engagement and delegate outreach&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The council also discussed possible speakers, discussion points, and session topics for College Board Forum 2014. Pam Paulson and Michael McDonough, chair and chair-elect of the AAC, discuss the work of the council below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;College Board All Access (CBAA)&lt;/strong&gt;: What are the top priorities of the Academic Assembly and how do they reflect major issues affecting academic professionals right now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pam Paulson (PP):&lt;/strong&gt; The top issues span a large range because education is a complex system that is connected or disconnected across the country, across grades pre-K–16, across disciplines, and even involving partnerships with outside institutions. If this enterprise wants our country to thrive and continue to innovate, all of our students must succeed and have the ability to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We must be concerned with both the students who are struggling and the students who are doing well. Both groups need to have the right amount of challenge and support to continue growing. Teachers are tasked with the enormous responsibility of educating all students in preparation for being contributing citizens who lead productive, fulfilled lives. This makes teacher preparation and professional development central issues in the education system. High-quality instruction that meets students’ needs leads to successful learners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to understand student academic performance and growth is to gather information from external measures of student achievement. The College Board offers high-quality tests and courses like SAT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and AP&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; that give students a sense of how they are doing on rigorous exams at a point in time. Academic achievement also includes continuous improvement so that students learn how to improve their work along the way — getting feedback to understand what they know and what they still need to learn. Feedback from their teacher, from experts in the field, from peers, even from self-assessments of their work can help students reflect and refine their thinking and skill development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is one reason the College Board is developing the AP Capstone™ program and diploma — to give students another way to learn from assessments and demonstrate their achievements. The Capstone project uses multiple forms of ongoing data to help students better understand their level of accomplishment and need. Students need to be inspired to do their best, and information about their progress is a key component of keeping them engaged in their own learning and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CBAA: &lt;/strong&gt;Talk about some key takeaways from the council meeting. Were there any surprises throughout the discussions? Any topics that were particularly divisive among council members?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael McDonough (MM):&lt;/strong&gt; At the most recent council meeting, members identified and discussed a number of engaging and timely topics. There was a dynamic conversation regarding how to better collaborate with members, especially during program redesign and draft assessments. Although much of this conversation focused on AP assessments, members were clear to identify other opportunities for enhanced collaboration and partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members also discussed the College Board’s significant capacity to report on a wide range of student data points. Members reviewed some initial data regarding community college retention, transfer, and completion, insisting that more focused analysis is needed, and that our language in framing and reporting this data not privilege one sector over another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the other wide-ranging discussions, four themes or topics seemed to emerge: the passionate support for access and equity; the strong advocacy for professional development opportunities at all levels; the sustained focus on supporting academic rigor; and the building interest in designing robust and transparent pathways for students as they transition into high school, college, or career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CBAA:&lt;/strong&gt; Are there any new topics on the horizon that committee members can expect to see on the agenda for the next meeting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PP&lt;/strong&gt;: As the Academic Council council, we are involved in gathering information to provide insights and advice as the College Board develops new academic initiatives or refines existing programs. Our involvement often is in an inquiry format as we ask questions meant to stimulate thinking about what is possible, what might be challenging when the programs actually get into schools, and what might be unforeseen issues. One area we know will capture our attention is diversity as we spend time asking how we can reach and teach all students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MM: &lt;/strong&gt;Assembly members are hoping to see more presentations and vigorous conversation regarding data analysis, especially related to the community college sector and to student success; to hear more about the emerging initiative in career technical education, and to help shape a more collaborative culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PP: &lt;/strong&gt;The future of this country and the world is dependent on an educated population. We cannot afford to educate only some of our students. In order to continue creating and making innovative products and services, we need to tap into the interests and talents of each student. This means we are interested in a broad range of opportunities for students to find their strengths and passions and consider their possibilities. Each of the disciplines brings something to the education of our students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By bringing together subject-area experts and regional leaders at council meetings, we can spend time thinking about how the interaction and combination of academic disciplines in the education system makes for an even more powerful education for our students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Academic Assembly Council Focuses on Instruction and Professional Development During Recent Meeting&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>Guidance and Admissions Assembly Meeting Focuses on Data, and Redesigned Assessments</title>

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the past chair, current chair, and chair-elect of the Assembly, participants heard from College Board President David Coleman and Vice President of Data Science, Jeff Olson. Olson presented the data team’s work to understand College Board data, and how it can be made available to members to improve their daily work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new focus on the use of College Board data is intended to “provide much better usability and insights for schools and institutions, and become a smarter organization ourselves,” said Olson. The interconnection between students and colleges particularly resonated with this group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ronne, Philip, and Barbara talked with All Access immediately after the meeting to discuss current and future priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CB All Access:&lt;/strong&gt; How does the material presented during today’s meeting play into the priorities of the guidance and admissions communities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Philip Ballinger:&lt;/strong&gt; One of our biggest priorities is reviewing and discussing College Board initiatives so that they can be well supported. This is built into the work of GAAC and the assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing is data. Jeff’s presentation makes it clear that we have access to a lot more data. Now, we must think about how we can use this data to assist and support students. That’s the primary focus—for example, there are a lot of PSAT takers who seem to disappear when it comes to their transition to college. We have to ask ourselves, what can we do to ameliorate that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another consideration is the appropriate use of this data. We have to think about where data might be a disservice to students, or used in an exclusionary way. Unfortunately, this data can be used in an irresponsible way by an institution. These considerations become more important as more data becomes readily available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another priority for the Assembly is the redesigned assessments. We have all of these new examinations, and a new academic program in AP Capstone, and we need to continue to discuss and understand these things as they continue to develop and affect our students and our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, there is our perennial topic of membership engagement. When we say we want to better engage members, we don’t mean that they simply feel connected to the work of the College Board, but that they’re fully participating in the work in some fashion. We want to be bold by what we mean by membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barbara Gill:&lt;/strong&gt; The folks who are already involved with the College Board feel very engaged; it’s the folks who are not yet engaged in a meaningful way—in a Council, a committee, or another group—that we need to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extending engagement beyond initial participation is important too. Once members are done serving on these councils and committees, we need to continue to engage with them. The Oak Circle [a group of former trustees who are part of a new program to continue their involvement in the College Board] is a great example, but we also need to do something with the national councils and the committees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assembly should work to find ways to extend our reach more broadly and more deeply across the membership, and really find ways to connect. The membership surveys find that those who are most involved with CB are the ones that appreciate the work the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ronne Patrick Turner:&lt;/strong&gt; As chair elect, I will be serving as GAAC chair during the time when the redesigned assessments will be delivered, and getting member feedback about the implementation of the redesign is really important. There will be a lot of things that we need to talk about and think about once the exam is implemented. There will be many opportunities for feedback and adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Times when we as members have the opportunity to get together and share and communicate—such as Forum—are really important to the value of membership, and we want to find ways to expand that engagement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Guidance and Admissions Assembly Meeting Focuses on Data, and Redesigned Assessments&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

A big question on the minds of K12 and higher ed member leaders alike was: what does PPY mean for students?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions among representatives from the College Board’s three national councils—Academic, Guidance and Admission, and College Scholarship Service—and six regional councils ranged from tackling the implications of prior-prior year for admissions and financial aid, to determining the future of membership and governance at the College Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlights include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The College Scholarship Service Assembly Council discussed the implications of PPY, and planned a 2-pronged approach. Step 1: gather and sift information from institutions, schools, and nonprofit organizations; Step 2: interpret that information and take action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Guidance and Admission Assembly Council addressed the implications specifically for the class of 2017, prior-prior year, the redesigned SAT, and the Coalition Application are just some of the major changes for this class.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Academic Assembly Council focused on establishing a connection between the College Board’s work in instruction and assessment. By leveraging technology to meet more frequently, the AAC can address issues in both areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All members identified a need to continue the discussion on PPY; its benefits for students, and implications for high schools and colleges. The College Board will continue to engage its members in these discussions, including during Assembly meetings at the upcoming National Forum in Washington, DC. &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.collegeboard.org/registration&quot;&gt;Register now to be part of the conversation!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;PPY Among Discussion Topics at College Board Joint Council Meeting&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The GAAC is a group of member professionals that considers issues and actions related to providing educational opportunities for all students at crucial transition points in their academic experience to help them succeed whenever or however they enter higher education. During the GAAC’s most recent meeting, the council discussed several important issues and programmatic developments, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examining ways to better engage College Board delegates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communication strategies around Access to Opportunity&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; and the redesigned SAT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New programs including AP Capstone&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; and the College Financial Information Program&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SAT and college application fee-waiver policy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Higher Education Act Reauthorization recommendations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The council also discussed possible speakers, discussion points, and session topics for College Board Forum 2014. Philip Ballinger, Assistant Vice President for Enrollment and Director of Admissions for undergraduates at the University of Washington, College Board Trustee and Chair of Guidance and Admission Assembly Council discusses the work of the council below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;College Board All Access&lt;/strong&gt;: What are the top priorities of the Guidance and Admissions Assembly Council and how do they reflect major issues affecting guidance professionals right now? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phillip Ballinger&lt;/strong&gt;: I will highlight only a couple of the many priorities. Clearly, the College Board is on the move, and the pace is rapid.  We are concerned with growing and fostering member engagement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Coleman has been both clear and accurate – the efficacy of the many student access and success initiatives of the Board will depend in large measure upon the engagement of the members. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With good reason College Board leadership stole Frank Ashley away from Texas A&amp;amp;M to head up this effort as Senior Vice President of Membership and Higher Education Engagement.  One of his first initiatives will be centered upon onboarding new delegates of the various assemblies.  Frank has also made it very clear that we have a lot of work to do in communicating more effectively and usefully with College Board members in general. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, a new SAT is in our future. Implementing such a significant shift affects students, teachers, and administrators at every level – one can imagine all the practical issues that could and will arise. GAAC is a superb gathering of colleagues from high schools and colleges of every type to discuss these issues together, and to make helpful suggestions and recommendations to those responsible for the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CBAA:&lt;/strong&gt; Talk about some key takeaways from the council meeting. Were there any surprises throughout the discussions? Were any topics particularly divisive among council members?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PB: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes, we did have some surprises – positive ones.  We are encouraged by the entrepreneurial leadership in place at the College Board.  Of course, to be entrepreneurial is to also be creative and willing to take risks.  People have different thoughts when it comes to some creative thinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, what could be the role – if any -- of various types of corporations in the College Board’s initiatives around student access and success?  When could there be conflicts of interest or possible mission drift at play?  The dynamics between a broad engagement of societal resources of every kind -- whether public, private or corporate -- and the good of students are complex, and members of GAAC have definite (and various) opinions about what is and what is not appropriate. My GAAC colleagues are not a shy bunch! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CBAA:&lt;/strong&gt; Are there any new topics on the horizon that assembly members can expect to see on the agenda for the next meeting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PB:&lt;/strong&gt; Certainly testing and related items will be in the forefront.  Also, assembly members will hear about and engage much more with developing access initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Guidance and Admission Assembly Council Explores New Programs and Policies During Recent Meeting&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
