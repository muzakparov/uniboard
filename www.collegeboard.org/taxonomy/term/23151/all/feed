This applies to entering freshmen at Illinois public institutions of higher education beginning in the fall of 2016.&lt;span&gt;A statewide AP college credit policy helps ensure that public universities and colleges consistently and fairly recognize AP students’ academic achievement and simultaneously provides these institutions with an innovative solution to improve retention and decrease time to degree.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;For Illinois students, families and educators, this means greater access to AP and all the opportunities that go along with it. With HB 3428 signed into law, Illinois now will have a statewide Advanced Placement credit policy ensuring that students receive the college credits they can earn as a result of their hard work in AP. At a time when AP participation and performance has increased significantly in the state, this law provides more students with a greater opportunity to graduate college on time. A bipartisan group of public officials in Illinois worked for this result, including Governor Rauner and the bill sponsors: Representatives Carol Sente and Mike Fortner and Senator Pat McGuire.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the Governors of Virginia and Texas signed into law similar legislation. With the Illinois bill signing, 17 states now award college credit state-wide or system-wide to students earning scores of 3 and higher on AP Exams. Efforts are underway in other states, including in Colorado, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Growing Momentum for AP Credit Policies in the States&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

While the California State University System (made up of 23 campuses) has a uniform policy of awarding credit for AP scores of 3 and higher, the California Community College System of 113 colleges lacks a system-wide approach. Each California Community College has its own individual AP credit policy — for example, 24 community colleges require scores of 4 for credit, 6 community colleges require a score of 5 for credit, and 10 community colleges have no AP credit policies at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 19, at the Assembly Higher Education Committee hearing at the California State Capitol, educators and students lined up to support of AB1985, a bill introduced by Assembly member Das Williams (D-Santa Barbara) that  would require California Community Colleges to develop and adopt a uniform policy of awarding general education course credits for AP exam scores of 3 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While all the University of California and California State University will accept a 3 for credit, in community colleges that is not the case,” explained Assembly member Williams at the hearing. “We find this to be a bait and switch for our students who are doing the hard work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rachel Lewis, an AP English teacher from Western Sierra Collegiate Academy in Rocklin, CA, testified in support of the bill. Her high school has had an inclusive AP program for the past 3 years, and every single junior takes AP English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Lewis told the Committee members how students every year who did well on the AP English exam would come back to tell her  how well prepared they felt for the English curriculum of their community colleges, state colleges, and private colleges. “I want my students to benefit from the full fruit of their labors and know their efforts are recognized and meaningful,” she said.  When not awarded college credit, she continued, “students who look at the AP test as a financial investment into their future are punished for their thoughtful planning. It is especially unfair to students who are already struggling to pay for college and are now essentially asked to pay for the same class twice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her powerful testimony was followed by the testimony of Western Sierra Collegiate Academy AP Literature and AP History student Hannah Blackmore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-income students, Blackmore explained, “usually turn to community colleges and  the AP system as our last hope to getting a college.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the testimonies, more students, educators, and civil justice advocates lined up in front of a microphone to express additional support for the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pam Kerouac, Senior Director of AP Higher Ed Policy at the College Board, who deferred her testimony to an AP teacher and student, said she was inspired by what she witnessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Watching restless legislators, after a long day, stop fidgeting and listen to each student was spectacular,” Ms. Kerouac said. “It was obvious they were not willing to stand by and let the inconsistent AP credit policy toss-up game continue affecting who gets college credit and who does not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill was passed unanimously out of the Assembly Higher Education Committee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We swept the vote count 13-0 in support,” said Ken Woods, Executive Director of Higher Education in California for the College Board, who also deferred his testimony at the hearing. “I have always been proud of working for the College Board, but in my 20 plus years, this was the highlight — we accomplished something that will impact so many students in California.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After clearing the Assembly, the bill will be heard in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no one better to speak truth to power than classroom teachers and their students,” said Julie Harris-Lawrence, said Executive Director of Teacher Outreach and Advocacy for the College Board. &quot;We look forward to bringing the voices of AP educators and students to the California State Senate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;California AP Students and Educators Fight for a Uniform AP Credit Policy&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Governor Jerry Brown has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=19559&quot;&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; into law &lt;a href=&quot;http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1985&quot;&gt;AB1985&lt;/a&gt;, legislation introduced by Assembly member Das Williams that requires California Community Colleges to develop and adopt a uniform policy of awarding general education course credits for Advanced Placement exam scores of 3 or higher. While the California State University System (made up of 23 campuses) has a uniform policy of awarding credit for AP scores of 3 and higher, the California Community College System of 113 colleges lacks a system-wide approach. Each California Community College has its own individual AP credit policy — for example, 24 community colleges require scores of 4 for credit, six community colleges require a score of 5 for credit, and 10 community colleges have no AP credit policies at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the bill signing, Scott Hill, vice president, College Board Western Regional Office said: “This is a tremendous victory for California students, families and educators. With AB1985 signed into law, California now will have a statewide Advanced Placement credit policy ensuring that students at community colleges receive the credits they earned as a result of their hard work in AP. At a time when AP participation and performance has increased significantly in the state, this law provides more students with a greater opportunity to graduate college on time and save money. The College Board is grateful for the leadership of Assembly member Williams, who authored the bill, and Governor Brown for signing the bill into law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 19, at an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/academic/california-ap-students-and-educators-fight-uniform-ap-credit-policy&quot;&gt;Assembly Higher Education Committee hearing&lt;/a&gt;, educators and students lined up to testify in support of AB1985. Rachel Lewis, an AP English teacher,  told the Committee members how students every year who did well on the AP English exam would come back to tell her  how well prepared they felt for the English curriculum of their community colleges, state colleges, and private colleges. “I want my students to benefit from the full fruit of their labors and know their efforts are recognized and meaningful. When not awarded college credit, students who look at the AP test as a financial investment into their future are punished for their thoughtful planning. It is especially unfair to students who are already struggling to pay for college and are now essentially asked to pay for the same class twice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law has support from the higher education community:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Said Frank Chong, Ed. D., president of Santa Rosa Junior College: “This new law will have a positive impact for our community. A uniform AP credit policy benefits students and parents planning for college and tuition affordability. Students won’t need to retake introductory courses in subjects where they’ve already demonstrated academic proficiency, propelling them more quickly to completion.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Said Eric Forbes, assistant vice chancellor, Academic Affairs/Student Academic Support, at California State University:  “CSU will work with our California community college partners to ensure that AP-course credits are also identified uniformly when students transfer to the CSU. Removing transfer pathway barriers is a benefit for students and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California is one of 20 states to have a statewide or system-wide uniform AP credit policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;California Adopts Uniform AP Credit Policy for Community Colleges&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Melanie Stambaugh, which requires the state’s public college and university system to establish a uniform policy of awarding college credit for Advanced Placement (AP) Exam scores of 3 or higher. Under current law, each institution is allowed to develop its own requirements for awarding credit, and some schools require higher scores than others. The new law takes effect this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.teachwithtvw.org/capitol-classroom/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Capitol Classroom&lt;/a&gt; who championed the bill throughout the legislative process were invited to witness the governor’s signing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The College Board thanks Washington officials and educators for their leadership in helping to ensure that students have the opportunity to receive the credits they’ve earned. Washington is the 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; state to enact a system-wide uniform AP credit policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Washington Establishes Statewide AP Credit Policy&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
