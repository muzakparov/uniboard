The exam, which is accepted at almost all colleges and universities in the United States, is now more focused than ever on testing the few things that matter most for college and career readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As international students prepare for the first administration of the redesigned exam in spring 2016, here are five things they should know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;During the process of redesigning the exam, the College Board International team engaged in conversations about the SAT with educators throughout the world. In addition, meetings with university admission leaders from across the U.S. included specific discussions on issues related to the international student experience. Their input and feedback helped ensure that the exam would remain relevant and meaningful for international students. We are also rigorously testing the exam through content reviews and individual item testing to ensure that it is valid and fair for all students.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The redesigned SAT measures the skills and knowledge that are essential for college and career readiness. This is true for all students, regardless of geography.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All students will benefit from having a clear understanding of what to expect when they take the exam. Every time students take the redesigned SAT, they will encounter a passage from one of the U.S. founding documents or the great global conversation they inspire. This refers to texts written not only in the United States but also important international texts, including pieces by Mahatma Gandhi, Margaret Thatcher, and Henry David Thoreau. Students do not need to have previous knowledge of any of the documents to successfully perform the analysis needed to answer the questions. The answer to every question in the Reading section will be based on the information provided by the reading passage.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rigorous course work — such as that done in the best classrooms around the world — will be the best preparation for the SAT.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As test day approaches, students can use our free test-prep resources to become familiar with the exam and hone their skills. Through a partnership with Khan Academy, we are making practice materials for the redesigned SAT available at no cost to students around the world. For students taking the current SAT, free practice materials are already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;available&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find out more information about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;redesigned SAT&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Five Things International Students Need to Know About the Redesigned SAT®&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Read the original &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/collegeboard/2016/03/01/what-students-should-know-before-sat-test-day/#2f2b36a163cd&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 5, high school students across the country will sit down to take a &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat&quot;&gt;new version of the SAT&lt;/a&gt; college admission test. Here are some important things they should keep in mind before arriving at their test center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best way to prepare for the SAT is to work hard in school and practice as much as possible. &lt;/strong&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;Official SAT Practice&lt;/a&gt; tools on Khan Academy, students have access to full-length practice tests, video lessons, and thousands of interactive questions that help students focus on the areas where they need the most work. There’s also an &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/practice/daily-practice-app&quot;&gt;SAT practice app&lt;/a&gt; for mobile devices, so on-the-go students can sharpen their skills anytime, anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students should check to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/register/college-essay-policies&quot;&gt;see if the SAT Essay is an admission requirement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; for any of their prospective colleges or scholarship providers&lt;/strong&gt;. If they haven’t registered to take the SAT with Essay, students may opt to take it when they check in at their test center, provided there are enough materials, space, and staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To be allowed inside the test center, students need to present a printed Admission Ticket and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/taking-the-test/id-requirements&quot;&gt;acceptable photo ID&lt;/a&gt;. The Admission Ticket can be accessed from the student’s College Board account. The information on the ticket and on their valid photo ID must match exactly; if the ticket says “Jenny” and the ID says “Jennifer,” that student won’t be allowed to enter the test center.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students should bring at least two No. 2 pencils and an &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/taking-the-test/calculator-policy&quot;&gt;approved calculator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to use on the part of the Math Test that allows calculators. &lt;/strong&gt;It’s a good idea to make sure the calculator works and has fresh batteries before the day of the test; there will be no calculators at the test center, and students will not be allowed to share them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/register/test-center-closings&quot;&gt;Test center closings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; are listed online before each test date as soon as a decision is made to close a center.&lt;/strong&gt; If inclement weather is expected, students should check the College Board website the night before and the morning of the test to make sure the test center is open. If they feel unsafe traveling on test day, they can call Customer Service to switch to a future test date free of charge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strongly recommended:&lt;/strong&gt; A good night’s rest, a healthy breakfast, extra batteries, a quiet watch, snacks for the break(s), and confidence — this is what they’ve been practicing for!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strongly recommended to leave at home: &lt;/strong&gt;Cellphones, tablets, MP3 players, cameras, rulers, or any other item on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/taking-the-test/test-day-checklist&quot;&gt;list of prohibited items&lt;/a&gt;. If a student brings a prohibited item on test day, test center staff have the authority to deny that student entry to the test center or to hold on to the item for the duration of the test. When it doubt, leave it at home.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We at the College Board send our best wishes to everyone taking the SAT this week!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;What Students Should Know Before SAT Test Day&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The SAT replaces the ACT as the state&#039;s college entrance exam. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Bids were received by both the College Board and ACT. The selection committee, composed of representatives from school districts across the state, opted for the College Board. They found that the College Board’s Practice SAT, given to 10th-graders, aligned better with the high school Colorado Academic Standards, a requirement of 2015 legislation, said Will Morton, director of assessment administration for the CDE.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sal Khan, founder and president of Khan Academy was also interviewed for the article. &lt;span&gt;“This SAT is is frankly so much easier, so much closer to what students are seeing in their classes,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorado is one of nine states – along with Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island – and the District of Columbia that will administer the SAT this year at no cost to all public school juniors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full article &quot;&lt;span&gt;Colorado juniors face new, revamped college exam in SAT after state dumps rival ACT&quot;&lt;/span&gt; here.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.denverpost.com/2017/03/06/colorado-juniors-sat-college-exam/&quot;&gt;http://www.denverpost.com/2017/03/06/colorado-juniors-sat-college-exam/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Colorado juniors gear up to take the SAT this spring&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Since the announcement, state officials, education leaders, and news outlets have voiced support for the change that will allow Michigan students, parents, and educators to take advantage of the opportunities College Board redesigned assessments have to offer. We&#039;re pleased to share a great editorial from the Detroit News. The full text and a link to the original article can be found below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State scores in switch to SAT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michigan students will take new college entrance exam in 2016, saving state money&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally posted on January 9 on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/01/09/michigan-chooses-sat-act/21458857/&quot;&gt;The Detroit News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to keep track of all the acronyms that fly around the education sphere, but the Michigan Department of Education’s decision to move to the SAT from the ACT is a significant change. While some school officials aren’t happy about dealing with a new test, it’s a switch that will save taxpayers money — and offer students some additional benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2007, all Michigan high school juniors have been required to take the ACT college entrance exam as part of the Michigan Merit Exam, in part to encourage more students to apply to college. Michigan law requires high school students to take a college entrance exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move to the SAT, starting in 2016, should be fairly seamless for students, according to department officials and some education reform experts. Like the ACT, the SAT will be offered free of charge to all juniors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everyone is pleased with this change. Some school administrators feel blindsided and upset they now have to meet a new target after years of building a curriculum around the ACT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Department officials should take these concerns seriously, especially since so much pressure is placed on schools to meet certain benchmarks on these tests. More leniency should be afforded schools as they transition to this new standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the financial savings are real, and it would have been careless of state officials to ignore that. The MDE said the College Board, which administers the SAT, won the three-year contract worth $17.1 million — a bid that was $15 million less than the ACT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Superintendent Mike Flanagan thinks this is a positive change, and points to how the SAT test “is respected and used around the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Their bid was rated the highest; provides valuable assistance to Michigan educators, students, and parents; is more aligned to Michigan’s content standards; and saves the state millions of dollars over the course of the three-year contract,” Flanagan said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MDE says to prepare for the new test, students can take practice tests, and teachers and other school officials will participate in professional development. This training is covered under the SAT contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students will benefit from these additional training opportunities. The College Board has partnered with Kahn Academy, the free, online learning resource, to provide free SAT preparation materials to all students starting in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Ackley, spokesman for the department, says nearly all colleges — including all universities in Michigan — accept the SAT test as well as the ACT, so students won’t be at a disadvantage for not taking the ACT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SAT tests students in reading, writing and math; the ACT has five parts: English, mathematics, reading, science and an optional writing test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education experts who have looked at the revamped SAT test — the one students will start taking in 2016 — say it will be more aligned to Michigan standards. Those include: requiring to back up claims, testing vocabulary in reading passages, fewer math topics but in more depth, and testing knowledge of U.S. founding documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition to the SAT will inevitably pose challenges at first, but the savings for the state and the added benefits for students made this the right call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Positive Response to Michigan SAT Announcement &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Read the original release on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/must-read-student-reactions-following-first-administration-of-the-new-sat-300231441.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PR Newswire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March 5, 2016  -- Today hundreds of thousands of students across the country took the first national administration of the redesigned SAT®. Changes to the test include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A focus on the areas of math that matter most&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An emphasis on more relevant vocabulary words&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No penalty for guessing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An optional essay&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The College Board conducted a survey of 8,089 students who completed the March SAT administration earlier today. We compared this year&#039;s results for some of the same questions to the responses of 6,494 examinees during the identical timeframe after the March 2015 SAT administration. Below you&#039;ll find student reactions to test content, information on how they prepared for the test, and some fun facts about their test day experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Test Content&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of students had positive reactions to taking the new SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;71% of students said the test reflected what they&#039;re learning in school.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;By a 6 to 1 margin, students said they preferred the format of the new SAT over the previous version of the test.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;75% of students said the Reading Test was the same as or easier than they expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;80% of students said the vocabulary on the test would be useful to them later in life, compared with 55% in March 2015.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;59% of students said the Math section tests the skills and knowledge needed for success in college and career.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Preparation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the test&#039;s redesign, the College Board partnered with Khan Academy® to offer free, personalized test practice to all students. Since the resources launched in June 2015, more than 900,000 students have taken advantage of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compared with March 2015 SAT administration, there was a 19% decrease in the number of students that paid for test prep resources.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nearly half of all examinees who took the SAT today prepared with Khan Academy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;98% of examinees who prepared with Khan Academy found it extremely, very, or somewhat helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fun Facts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to know what students ate before taking the test? Here&#039;s what they had to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;3 hot cakes with maple syrup, one sausage patty, and a hash brown.&quot; –Nhan, 16, NC&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Sunny side up eggs with cayenne pepper on oat nut bread toast.&quot; –Alex, 17, PA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;An English muffin with butter and peanut butter and a banana with coffee.&quot; –Stephanie, 18, PA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avocado on corn tortilla, and a pumpkin protein bar.&quot; –Kelly, 17, IL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s how students said they&#039;re celebrating after completing the SAT:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I performed a rendition of &lt;span&gt;Aretha Franklin&#039;s&lt;/span&gt; hit single &#039;Think (Freedom).&#039;&quot; –Matthew, 17, PA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I&#039;m going to treat myself with ice cream.&quot;–Ramis, 16, FL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Order Chinese food and go rock climbing.&quot; –Lawrence, 16, VA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many SAT-takers listened to music to focus before the test. Here are their favorite songs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.    &quot;Work&quot; by Rihanna &lt;br /&gt;1.    &quot;Love Yourself&quot; by &lt;span&gt;Justin Bieber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.    &quot;7 Years&quot; by &lt;span&gt;Lukas Graham&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3.    &quot;Stressed Out&quot; by Twenty One Pilots &lt;br /&gt;4.    &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; by Zayn &lt;br /&gt;5.    &quot;Sorry&quot; by &lt;span&gt;Justin Bieber&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;6.    &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; by Eminem &lt;br /&gt;7.    &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot; by Survivor &lt;br /&gt;8.    &quot;River Flows In You&quot; by Yiruma&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;In Their Own Words&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I felt I was academically ready and knew the format and general difficulty of the test.&quot; –Samuel 17, NJ&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I would describe it as taking any test that you would take at school. It&#039;s also like taking the PSAT (&lt;span&gt;NMSQT&lt;/span&gt;).&quot; –Jocelyn 17, IN&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Khan Academy was literally a godsend. I have never really been a math-centric person, and so pre-calculus is a little rough. I had already been using Khan Academy and when I hooked up my PSAT (&lt;span&gt;NMSQT&lt;/span&gt;) scores it showed me all of the math I had to review.&quot; –Nicole, 17, NH&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I felt like I had a good amount of time to completely read through the passages and select my answers as well as review some of the ones that were difficult for me.&quot; –Elizabeth, 17, WA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional information about the SAT can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sat.org/new&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Autumn Loss, a senior at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ublyschools.org/&quot;&gt;Ubly Community High School&lt;/a&gt; in Ubly, Michigan, has done what seemed impossible: she increased her &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sat.org/&quot;&gt;SAT&lt;/a&gt; score by 200 points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between taking the PSAT/NMSQT and the SAT, Autumn can tell you there was no expensive test prep involved, no mystery tricks to help her get the right answers. She simply practiced two to three times a week with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.satpractice.org/&quot;&gt;Official SAT Practice&lt;/a&gt;, the free, personalized, online SAT practice tools created through a partnership between Khan Academy and the College Board.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I loved that it gave me a broad range of questions I could practice,” said Autumn. “I could see my progress.” She practiced in class and outside of school, a few times a week, on the iPad Ubly Community provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy builds a personalized study plan for each student. By linking their College Board and Khan Academy accounts, they can use their scores from the SAT, &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/psat-nmsqt-psat-10&quot;&gt;PSAT/NMSQT, PSAT 10,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/psat-8-9&quot;&gt;PSAT 8/9&lt;/a&gt; to get personalized recommendations about what to learn next. In seconds, they get a&lt;span&gt;ccess to video lessons, full-length practice tests, thousands of interactive questions, and more. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official SAT Practice helped Autumn feel confident on test day because it focused her study time on the areas where she most needed to improve—in her case, in math—and demystified the format of the questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I struggled in math, and the videos made the problems easier to understand because they walked me through how they were worded,” she said. “I really liked the videos explaining the questions, so I could figure out the question on my own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For me, Official SAT practice was not only free, but also very convenient,” Autumn added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the tools became available in June 2016, more than 3.7 million users have logged on to practice for the SAT on Khan Academy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every one of the 270 students at Ubly Community High School has at some point or another logged onto Official SAT Practice in the last year. The teachers have integrated 30 minutes of practice on Khan Academy into their math and language arts classes each week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since we cover it in class every week, I think students understand this is important,” said Janice Brandel, a school counselor at Ubly Community. “I think students and teachers see a reason to pay attention, and there&#039;s a lot of buy-in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubly Community students not only take the PSAT/NMSQT and the SAT during the school day at no cost, but the PSAT 8/9 and PSAT 10 as well, which allows younger students to identify early on where they need to improve over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Brandel says that having access to free SAT preparation through Khan Academy opens doors for her students. While some may head to a trade school after graduation, taking the SAT gives them the chance to apply to college later if they change their minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t tell them you have to get this score or that score,” she said. “We tell students, we want you to do your best. Whatever your goals are, we don’t want you to have any barriers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fall, Autumn will head to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.delta.edu/&quot;&gt;Delta College&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.michigan.gov/mistudentaid/0,4636,7-128-60969_61016-274565--,00.html&quot;&gt;TIP&lt;/a&gt; scholarship. After two years, she plans to transfer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://msu.edu/&quot;&gt;Michigan State University&lt;/a&gt; and study agricultural education and natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you know any students who would like to sign up to Official SAT Practice, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;satpractice.org&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Practice Pays Off: Autumn Loss, Ubly, Michigan&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>Update on the Saturday, June 6, SAT Administration</title>

The time allotted for a specific math or reading section, either section 8 or 9 depending on the edition, was incorrect in the student test books and correct in the script and manual provided to test center supervisors. The student test books said the section was 25 minutes, while the manual and script contained the correct time limit of 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We apologize for this error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as ETS became aware of the error, during the administration of the test, they worked to provide accurate guidance to supervisors and administrators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After review and analysis , the College Board and ETS have determined that the affected sections will not be scored and we will still be able to provide reliable scores for all students who took the SAT on June 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To accommodate the wide range of incidents that can impact a test administration, the SAT is designed to collect enough information to provide valid and reliable scores even with an unscored section. From fire drills and power outages to mistiming and disruptive behavior, school-based test administrations can be fragile, so our assessments are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colleges and universities can be confident that the scores are valid. We expect to deliver scores to students within the usual timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We take our responsibility to students very seriously, and we regret the confusion some students experienced.

&lt;p&gt;Jack Buckley, senior vice president for research at the College Board, discussed various claims being made about the purpose of assessments like the SAT. Backed by recent research findings, Buckley also talked about the unintended consequences of going test optional. Below are some highlights (edited for length and clarity):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First claim: High school grade point average (HSGPA) alone is a better predictor of college success. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack: This is simply not true. The College Board’s new&lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/pdf/redesigned-sat-results-pilot-validity-study.pdf&quot;&gt; pilot predictive validity study&lt;/a&gt; found that the SAT predicts first-year success in college as well as HSGPA does, and that looking at SAT scores in conjunction with HSGPA is the best predictor overall. That’s as true now with the new SAT as it was with the SAT given before March 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second claim: Test-optional admission policies increase access and diversity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack: When we look at the very best research, there is little or no evidence that test-optional policies increase diversity. In fact, the opposite appears to be true. The two best studies that I can think of — which are independent studies, not the College Board’s — find exactly the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aera.net/Newsroom/Recent-AERA-Research/The-Test-Optional-Movement-at-Americas-Selective-Liberal-Arts-Colleges-A-Boon-for-Equity-or-Something-Else&quot;&gt;Belasco et al. study&lt;/a&gt; looked over time at some of the best-known liberal arts schools that were early test-optional institutions. The study controlled for other changes that occurred over the same period of time, and what it found over the long run was that going test optional caused a &lt;em&gt;decrease&lt;/em&gt; in racial and economic diversity on those campuses, exactly the opposite impact that the institutions claimed it would have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://gradworks.umi.com/36/62/3662081.html&quot;&gt;2014 dissertation by John McLaughlin&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of Smith College, included a statistical analysis of Smith’s experience going test optional in 2008. What he found after looking at the evidence was that, compared to other single-gender institutions, white women were more likely to apply to Smith after it went  test optional, and black women were less likely to apply. As a result, Smith was less diverse, which McLaughlin said was an unfortunate side effect of a test-optional policy shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third claim: If standardized tests exist, then wealthy students with access to high-cost test prep and coaching are going to have an unfair advantage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack: We looked at this claim at the College Board and decided that, while we don’t know if it is true, we have the ability to make it false. So we partnered with Khan Academy to provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;free, personalized practice&lt;/a&gt; to all students. After looking at initial data following the first administration of the new SAT, we’ve had more than 1 million unique students use Khan Academy — that’s four times as many students who use all major commercial test prep combined. That’s also 60–70 percent of every demographic or income subgroup, including students from families who make $250,000 or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;What Does the Research Say on Test Optional?&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

At the high school level, the state will use the PSAT and SAT to meet federal testing requirements. Currently all Rhode Island 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; graders take the PSAT and all 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; graders take the SAT at no cost during a school day. The state is in discussions with Massachusetts to use “RICAS,” a Rhode Island administration of the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS), for grades 3-8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Taken together, this combination of RICAS and PSAT/SAT provides us with the best, most consistent measure of student progress, without placing undue burden on students and educators,” Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education Ken Wagner said in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ride.ri.gov/InsideRIDE/AdditionalInformation/News/ViewArticle/tabid/408/ArticleId/387/Rhode-Island-to-Adopt-New-State-Assessment-Service-Providers.aspx&quot;&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;. “This approach will provide continuity in the classroom for teachers and students, maintain high quality assessment information about student progress, build a long-term partnership with a high performing neighboring state, and further decrease testing time. The short-term impact will be small, but the long-term benefits have the potential to be significant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Rhode Island to Adopt New State Assessments&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Starting in 2017, the public charter school in Northwest Detroit will require that every student take a least one AP course as a requirement for graduation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My vision in founding JRLA was to provide Detroit families with a quality private school education in a tuition-free public school setting,” Mr. Rose explained. “To realize that vision, we have to set academic standards of excellence and provide the kind of rigorous curriculum that is common to the best private high schools. Partnering with the College Board to introduce Advanced Placement courses on a grand scale at our open admission Detroit high school is a natural progression as we continue to raise the bar,” the former NBA star and current ABC/ESPN Analyst declared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jalen Rose Leadership Academy will be the first school in Detroit to establish that its students – referred to as scholars - take an AP course as a graduation requirement. All students, save those with certain special needs, will be expected to meet this requirement. Additionally, any JRLA scholar on a path to a four-year college will be encouraged to take four AP courses, one in each core area of science, math, English, and social studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wendell Hall, Senior Director for Policy at the College Board, attended the event to support the kick off of the ambitious program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The College Board is committed to ensuring that all students who have the potential to succeed in AP courses are able to access those opportunities,” he said. “That is why we work with schools like the Jalen Rose Leadership Academy to remove barriers and expand opportunity. We thank JLRA for its efforts to provide access to the challenging course work that will prepare students for success in college.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with the Jalen Rose Leadership Academy to provide the AP program to its scholars is a part of the College Board’s efforts to deliver opportunity to students everywhere. Through the &lt;em&gt;All In&lt;/em&gt; campaign, the College Board is committed to working with educators to break down barriers and ensure that 100 percent of African American, Hispanic, and Native American students with the potential to succeed in AP enroll in at least one matched AP course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rose stated that this commitment to raise the bar for students at Jalen Rose Leadership Academy reflects his belief that the majority of Detroit children who go to regular open-admission high schools have the same ability and promise as those accepted to the special test-admission schools in the city such as Renaissance High School and Cass Tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s time we set the same high expectations for all our students as we do for those who attend private or special admissions schools.  I have no doubt our scholars will rise to the occasion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jalen Rose Leadership Academy is managed by the non-profit &lt;a href=&quot;http://promiseschools.org/&quot;&gt;American Promise Schools (APS).&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.voyageurcollegeprep.com/&quot;&gt;Consortium College Prep&lt;/a&gt;, the other high school APS manages in Detroit, has made a similar commitment to increase its graduation requirements and introduce AP courses at an ambitious scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Jalen Rose Leadership Academy to Expand Opportunity for Detroit Students Through New Focus on AP Courses&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We agree that the challenges of test security internationally are escalating. Like many technology and publishing companies who are protecting patents and copyrights, we’re facing cartel-like companies in China and other countries that will stop at nothing to enrich themselves. These bad actors will continue to lie, cheat, and steal to the detriment of students who work hard and play by the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board is not perfect; we did our best with the information we had at the time. We can and should do more. In fact, we have recently taken more aggressive actions to secure the exam internationally, including canceling an administration in China. We continue to balance widening access with protecting the exam. We recently refused entry to the first administration of the redesigned SAT to a number of high-risk registrants — many of whom make a living violating security protocols. In the future, we will need to do even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been working with Reuters on these stories since summer 2015. During that period, we’ve made College Board leadership available for multiple interviews and shared more details about test security than we’ve provided any other news organization. We’ve been transparent with Reuters in an effort to make sure its readers better understand all that we do to protect the integrity of the SAT internationally and ensure the validity of the test scores we report. In the spirit of full transparency, we are sharing here the &lt;a href=&quot;https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/reuters-response.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;detailed letter&lt;/a&gt; we sent to Reuters with the facts of our decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as we recognize where we need to do more, we are so proud of the new SAT and its impact on students. This is a time of remarkable, positive change for our century-old organization. In early March, more than 460,000 students took the redesigned SAT, which better reflects what students are learning in the classroom and connects them with distinct opportunities such as free practice tools and college application fee waivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are especially grateful to Cyndie Schmeiser and Stacy Caldwell for leading the successful transition to the redesigned SAT. We should all be proud of the very real impact we are having on the lives of students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will continue to work with our members to expand educational opportunities for students everywhere in the world while doing all that we can to protect those students from the bad actors who lie, cheat, and steal for personal gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;A note to our members regarding today’s Reuters articles&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

To accommodate the August testing date, the January administration of the SAT has been discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to offer the August administration was made in close consultation with our members and the students we serve. Feedback to the proposed change from students, K–12 and higher education professionals, and test center supervisors was overwhelmingly positive. This shift will provide students with an earlier opportunity to take the SAT and the SAT Subject Tests before submitting college applications, and it will give them more time to focus on coursework, school activities, and college applications in the fall of their senior year. Students will also be able to use fee waivers from the current school year to register for the August SAT and SAT Subject Tests; they just need to get the completed first section of the waiver from their counselors before the school year ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The College Board will continue to work closely with counselors, test center supervisors, and college admissions officers to ensure that they are well prepared for the change and can continue to offer students guidance on when they should take the SAT and the SAT Subject Tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out more about registration deadlines and available SAT Subject Tests for all of the 2017-2018 administrations, please visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/register&quot;&gt;College Board’s website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Registration Opens for First August SAT and SAT Subject Test Administration&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

It has been an important part of the college admission process for millions of students since its introduction in 1926, and it remains an important part of that process today. As the former head of undergraduate admission at Stanford University, Occidental College, and Vassar College, I’ve seen firsthand how SAT scores and high school grades combine to become a strong predictor of first-year college success. And soon, the SAT will have an even stronger connection to the work that students are doing in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning next spring, students who take the SAT will see a new version of the test. Before redesigning the test, the College Board looked at the research that shows what skills and knowledge students need to know to be ready for college and career. We also listened to feedback from students, parents, teachers, and college and university professionals. The result is a test that is more useful, focused, and clear than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the changes that students taking the test in March 2016 and anytime thereafter should be aware of include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Content that is better aligned to what they’re already learning in class. Now there’s a clearer connection between what students are learning in school and the skills and knowledge we’re assessing on the SAT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A focus on the areas of math that research has shown to be most important for college success. For example, proportions and algebraic linear equations will be on the test; logic puzzles that have little connection to the math students are learning in class will not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A focus on vocabulary that students are likely to use again in college and career. Two words students won’t see on the test: “prevaricator” and “sagacious.” They may see a word like “synthesis,” however, which is used often in the contexts of chemistry, philosophy, biology, and psychiatry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No penalty for guessing. Students will earn points for the questions they get right — but won’t have points subtracted if they choose the wrong answer. There are also fewer answer options for multiple-choice questions — four, instead of five — so students making an educated guess are more likely to choose the correct answer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The College Board wants every student to have an equal opportunity to practice for the redesigned SAT, regardless of their financial situation. That’s why we’ve teamed up with Khan Academy®, a leader in online education, to provide all students with high-quality, personalized SAT practice absolutely free. This partnership will level the playing field by providing official SAT study tools to all students who want them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official SAT Practice — which launched in early June — is an interactive experience that identifies the areas individual students need to work on based on how they answer short quizzes and official SAT sample questions. It then tailors a study plan for each student and provides instant feedback so students can know how they’re doing and be proud of the progress they’re making. Of course, the best way to practice for the new SAT is to take challenging courses in high school and work hard in those courses. Official SAT Practice is intended to reinforce the great work already being done in class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer is a time to relax, read for pleasure, and recharge. It’s also a great time for students to explore Official SAT Practice. We look forward to seeing these students — and all students who follow — benefit from the changes we’ve made to the SAT and succeed in college, career, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fresno Unified, the largest school district in the Central Valley, has taken an “all-in approach” to preparing its students for success after high school. To ensure that all juniors have the opportunity to benefit from the SAT, the district is administering the college entrance exam at every one of its high schools on Tuesday, April 12. Students will take the SAT during the school day for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Shott, a local continuation high school student who is participating in this year’s SAT School Day administration, told reporter Juanita Stevenson, “The fact that Fresno Unified is letting this continuation school take the SAT for the first time — it shows that they haven’t really given up on us yet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help these students feel confident walking into the test, the district has also partnered with the College Board, Khan Academy, and the Boys and Girls Club to offer free online tutoring. Students have been busy preparing with Khan Academy’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;free practice tools&lt;/a&gt; during the school day and then seamlessly continuing their practice after school at three local Boys and Girls Clubs. Thanks to a donation of 94 computers to these Clubs, even students who do not have a computer or access to the internet at home have the chance to practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s about access, and giving all kids a fair shake,” Superintendent Mike Hansen told Juanita Stevenson. He hopes that that this approach of removing barriers will encourage Fresno Unified students to take advantage of the opportunity to succeed. “We want them to know — as a superintendent, as a board, as principals, teachers, educators, as a community — we believe in you, we know you can do it. It’s sitting right in front of you. Come do it. Write your own ticket.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Data Links Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy to Substantial Student Score Gains from the PSAT/NMSQT to the Redesigned SAT</title>

&lt;p&gt;On May 8, 2017, the College Board and Khan Academy announced promising new findings, based on data from the first full year of the new SAT&lt;strong&gt;®&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was time to shatter once and for all the bad idea that the SAT was an aptitude test, that the SAT measures something that’s unclear and hard to change. The new SAT makes it easier than ever for students to show their best work,” said College Board president and CEO David Coleman. “Students who devote themselves to free, personalized SAT practice on Khan Academy are achieving substantial score gains on the new SAT and claiming their futures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Studying for the SAT on Official SAT Practice for 20 hours is associated with an average score gain of 115 points&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s nearly double the average score gain achieved by students who don&#039;t use Khan Academy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the nearly 250,000 test takers studied, &lt;strong&gt;more than 16,000 gained 200 points or more between the PSAT/NMSQT® and SAT&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the 115-point average score increase associated with 20 hours of practice, shorter practice periods also correlate with meaningful score gains. For example, &lt;strong&gt;6–8 hours of practice on Official SAT Practice is associated with an average 90-point increase&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board waited for a full year of data to analyze before releasing these results. Researchers confirmed that practice advanced students regardless of their gender, race, income, and high school GPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we’re so excited about is every young person in America getting the chance to learn a powerful lesson: that through devoted practice you can advance yourself,” said Coleman. “These tests can never tell you who you are, and they never should have. They are only an invitation to what you might become through practice. We’re trying to do everything in our power to make the SAT a launching pad from which students can change their future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/opinion/owning-your-own-future.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; op-ed columnist Thomas L. Friedman celebrated the news, dubbing Official SAT Practice a proven tool for promoting lifelong learning and “owning your own future.” He wrote: “If you want to be a lifelong employee anywhere today, you have to be a lifelong learner. And that means: More is now on you. And that means self-motivation to learn and keep learning becomes the most important life skill...Some are up for that, some not; and many want to but don’t know how, which is why the College Board has reshaped the PSAT and SAT exams to encourage lifelong learning...The good news is that systems—like Khan-College Board—are emerging everywhere to enable anyone to accelerate learning for the age of acceleration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/average-score-gains-on-redesigned-sat&quot;&gt;Read the full press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRACTICE TAKES OFF.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its launch in June 2015, more than 3.7 million students have used Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy. Nearly 40 percent of all test takers reported using Official SAT Practice, making it the number one tool for SAT preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The SAT is a strong measure of college readiness. It is heartening to see this positive association between personalized practice on Khan Academy and growth in college readiness,” said Khan Academy founder and CEO Sal Khan. “This was only possible because of the hard work of many people, especially incredible teachers, counselors and school districts who have leveraged these practice tools for their students.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GET READY FOR TEST DAY.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind every story of student success is a teacher, counselor, advisor, coach, parent, or other caring adult.&lt;/p&gt;

We’ve put together a teacher/coach implementation guide, handouts for students and parents, video resources, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
