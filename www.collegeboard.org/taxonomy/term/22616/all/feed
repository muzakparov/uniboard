But his early experiences of seeing other family members incarcerated or placed into the foster care system have instilled within him a desire to build empowering learning experiences for young adults who have been impacted by poverty, violence, or cultural marginalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I work with and for youth who have been underserved by our educational and criminal justice systems in part because of the ways my own family has experienced inequities in these systems,” Perry explained. “The work is deeply personal for me because when people discuss the statistics and have high-minded debates about structural issues, they’re talking about my loved ones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a College Board fellow, Perry took a position with &lt;a href=&quot;https://theresetfoundation.org/&quot;&gt;The Reset Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, a San Francisco–based nonprofit dedicated to breaking the poverty to prison cycle. In his role as executive director, Perry focuses on running the foundation’s first Reset campus — a residential community that provides a healthy living environment, academic guidance and support, and career preparation skills for at-risk youth — a model the organization hopes will serve as an alternative to incarceration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to joining The Reset Foundation, Perry worked with the New York City Department of Education’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://schools.nyc.gov/Offices/ESI/default.htm&quot;&gt;Expanded Success Initiative (ESI)&lt;/a&gt;, a program designed to increase the number of black and Latino young men who graduate high school and are prepared for college and career success. As a school design fellow, he helped build and launch a competency-based high school model for those communities and was involved in developing professional learning systems centered on cultural relevance, restorative practice/justice, and youth development practice.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perry holds a doctorate in education leadership from Harvard, masters’ degrees from the University of California, Berkeley (public policy) and the University of Pennsylvania (education), and a dual degree in political science and international studies from American University. He was a reading and language arts teacher with Teach for America in Philadelphia, and has worked with the Los Angeles Unified School District on professional development for teachers and principals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College Board Fellow Paul Perry On Building Empowering Learning Experiences for Underrepresented Students&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>College Board Fellow Jermaine Wright On Increasing Opportunity for Men of Color in Higher Education</title>

&lt;p&gt;“In Jamaica, race as a social construct had no bearing as we were all Jamaicans,” Wright explained. “Class, on the other hand, determined how one would be treated and the opportunities you were afforded. In the Jamaican system of inequality, an increase in income signaled a change in status.” But once his family moved to the United States, Wright began to understand just how significant an impediment race can be to improving one’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unbeknownst to me, my family’s migration to America meant that we were leaving one system of inequity for another,” he said. “In the American system of inequity escape is far more challenging, because the inequity is predicated on race and the color of one’s skin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he formed an understanding of the entrenched structural challenges that many minority groups face here, Wright set out to address them through a career dedicated to providing expanded educational opportunities and improved social justice outcomes. As a College Board fellow, Wright works to create a level playing field for men of color through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.cuny.edu/sites/bmi/&quot;&gt;City University of New York’s Black Male Initiative (BMI)&lt;/a&gt;, a program designed to increase, encourage, and support the number of students from underrepresented groups in higher education. As interim university director of the Black Male Initiative, Wright oversees 32 campus-based projects focused on improving diversity recruitment, providing structured mentoring opportunities, and creating inclusive academic programming for students of color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to his work with the BMI, Wright is both a student and adjunct professor at the Rutgers University School of Public Affairs and Administration. He is scheduled to complete work on his Ph.D. in public administration in 2016, and will offset some of the cost of his remaining dissertation credits with the financial award he received from his College Board fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright also holds a master’s degree in public administration from the City University of New York (CUNY) and a bachelor’s degree in political science and sociology from the State University of New York (SUNY) at Binghamton. Previously, he was an adjunct professor at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., and a regional program manager for the National Urban League. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College Board Fellow Jermaine Wright On Increasing Opportunity for Men of Color in Higher Education&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

From working with Teach for America as a vice president of African American community partnerships to serving as the commissioner of the Memphis City/Shelby County Schools Board of Education, Ms. Hart has been a strong advocate for expanding educational opportunities for all students.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Striving to improve educational outcomes in the city, Ms. Hart focused her efforts on the Memphis Talent Dividend (MTD), a collaborative initiative of private citizens, businesses, nonprofits, higher education institutions, and the city of Memphis designed to increase the number of college graduates in the metropolitan area. With her assistance, the organization produced a citywide campaign this past January to help students understand and complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which can be a significant barrier to college entry for first-generation students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a first-generation college student, I know the challenges students face,” Hart says. “When we provide students with knowledge about what it takes to get to and to be successful in college, including the need to take AP courses, how to complete the FAFSA, how to navigate the entire college application process, we open up a world of possibilities for them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a College Board Professional fellow, Hart was able to support a related MTD program — the African American Male Initiative — as it expanded its efforts to make college more attainable in a city where only 43 percent of black men graduate from high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am equipping African American male students with the tools and resources they need for postsecondary success,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Hart recently accepted the position of vice president for programs at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.southerneducation.org/&quot;&gt;Southern Education Foundation (SEF)&lt;/a&gt;, an Atlanta-based nonprofit dedicated to advancing equity and excellence in education for Southern students. In her new role, Hart will work to improve student outcomes from early childhood to adulthood and engage in advocacy, research, and coalition-building activities across the region. Her early efforts will focus on Atlanta, Birmingham, Charlotte, Little Rock, Memphis, Nashville, and the Mississippi Delta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While it was a very difficult decision to leave Memphis, I accepted the offer, as it is an amazing opportunity to serve low-income students and students of color across the south,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hart holds a J.D. from the University of Memphis, an MBA from Kennesaw State University in Georgia, and a bachelor’s degree in education from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. She previously served as CEO of the Memphis Urban League and was an associate attorney at Ford &amp;amp; Harrison LLP in Memphis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College Board Fellow Tomeka Hart on Advancing Equity and Excellence for Minority Students&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
