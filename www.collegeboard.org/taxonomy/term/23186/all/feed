&lt;p&gt;Starting on September 17, the Interactive Constitution will be available at constitutioncenter.org/constitution. It is the only one-stop resource where users can explore the most current debates about the U.S. Constitution and immerse themselves in the words and ideas of the document. Users will be able to click on any provision of the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights and read a joint statement from leading conservative and liberal scholars, along with separate statements about areas of disagreement. The Interactive Constitution also includes a Rights Interactive that allows users to click on any provision of the U.S. Bill of Rights, explore its historic antecedents in colonial and revolutionary era constitutions, and then trace its influence around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“America’s Founding Documents, and the Constitution in particular, have inspired a great conversation about freedom, justice, and human dignity that continues to this day. It is a conversation that we need more students to be prepared to join through the careful study of these remarkable documents,” said College Board President and CEO David Coleman. “We are delighted to partner with the National Constitution Center to help deliver the Interactive Constitution to students and teachers across the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Interactive Constitution project is part of the College Board’s ongoing commitment to providing students and teachers with opportunities to encounter the American Founding Documents. Advanced Placement courses encourage teachers and students to immerse themselves in the Founding Documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board has worked with the National Constitution Center to develop lesson plans for the current school year for AP&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; U.S. Government and Politics and AP Comparative Government and Politics connected to the National Constitution Center’s online resources. Together they also are in the process of developing a module for AP U.S. History, as well as one for middle school classrooms, both of which will be completed later this year. Teachers and students across the world can access these high-quality resources for free from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses&quot;&gt;course homepages&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of whether they participate in the AP Program or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the College Board announced that every redesigned SAT exam would include a passage from a Founding Document or from the great global conversation they inspired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Interactive Constitution is a unique and meaningful educational tool that has the potential to transform constitutional discourse in America,” said Jeffrey Rosen, president and CEO of the National Constitution Center. “It’s exciting to bring together some of the top legal scholars in America to explore areas of agreement and disagreement about the text and history of the Constitution, the one document that unites all Americans in these polarized times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create the Interactive Constitution, the National Constitution Center established the Coalition of Freedom, an advisory board co-chaired by leaders of the American Constitution Society and The Federalist Society to commission scholars in America with different legal approaches and views to contribute explanatory material about all provisions of the U.S. Constitution and the Amendments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Constitution continues to have remarkable impacts not only in our country but across the world, where the Bill of Rights has served as a model and touchstone for what “freedom” can mean,” Coleman said. “The College Board is proud that the Interactive Constitution and our AP courses encourage students and teachers to immerse themselves in these timeless documents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College Board and National Constitution Center Announce New Online &amp;quot;Interactive Constitution&amp;quot; for Students and Teachers&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>The Partners that Make the College Board Stronger</title>

&lt;p&gt;One of those partners that make us stronger is bringing the U.S. Constitution to life with technology. Jeffrey Rosen, president and CEO of the National Constitution Center, has led the development of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution&quot;&gt;Interactive Constitution&lt;/a&gt;. With this innovative tool, students can explore the historic roots of each amendment, compare U.S. and international protections, and read opposing views to the interpretation of each amendment. “I believe this exercise of civil discourse does have the potential to transform constitutional education in America,” said Rosen.  AP U.S. History teachers are already using this tool, and Rosen hopes all students will use the Interactive Constitution to learn about history and become more informed citizens.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman also introduced Fidel Vargas, president and CEO of the Hispanic Scholarship Fund (HSF), as the “leader of a revolutionary effort engaging students in their work.”  HSF uses data from the PSAT/NMSQT to identify Hispanic students for scholarship opportunities. Vargas pointed out that one thing that often gets overlooked is that 93 percent of Latinos under the age of 18 living in the United States are U.S. citizens, and that’s important to keep in mind when considering the country’s future. To date, HSF has awarded more than half a billion dollars to over 6,500 Latino students and alumni.  “As a nation, whether we are training leaders to go into politics or into science or into law, there is a training and a mentorship that in some ways has been lost,” said Vargas, “so it’s not just the scholarships we give these students, it’s the support — the mentorship we are providing — that is making the real difference in accelerating their career paths.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another man focused on propelling careers forward is Hadi Partovi, co-founder and CEO of Code.org, another College Board partner. “Hadi has an ambitious and timely agenda that is sweeping this country,” said Coleman. After Partovi introduced a program titled “One Hour of Code,” in which any school in America can receive a free, 60-minute video tutorial on how to code, students have clocked more than 100 million hours of code in the past two years. “Every single child should learn about algorithmic thinking or how the Internet works — it’s just a basic thing that every child in the 21st century should have as part of their well-rounded education,” said Partovi. More than 5 million students took the tutorial, 2 million of whom were girls. Since launching our partnership with Code.org, over 90 school districts nationwide have added computer science courses, and the enrollment in AP Computer Science A has almost doubled, making it the fastest-growing course for the College Board.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Coleman, partnerships are about not only enhancing the College Board’s services to students and families but also offering support to institutions that can benefit from the collaboration.  “Assessment without opportunity is dead,” said Coleman in his closing remarks, “but with these kinds of partners, the College Board can share very powerful things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;The Partners that Make the College Board Stronger&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
