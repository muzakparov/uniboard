Dr. Joyce Brown is a leader in implementing FAFSA tracking programs across the country. These programs were built from pilot programs started in the Chicago Public School system. “When you get FAFSA done, magic happens,” said Brown when sharing key strategies for getting more students to complete their forms. Brown mentioned that counselors must be engaged in a way that transforms practices into outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although FAFSA completion rates are going up, we have lots of work to do. There is a national focus from President Obama and the First Lady with her &lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/reach-higher&quot;&gt;Reach Higher initiative&lt;/a&gt;. The Department of Education can now provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://studentaid.ed.gov/about/data-center/student/application-volume/fafsa-completion-high-school&quot;&gt;state-level completion data&lt;/a&gt; that districts and counselors can use to engage with students in meaningful ways. Key strategies include data cleaning, encouraging the creation of pin numbers, training events for counselors, completion events and workshops and close tracking of progress. There are great resources available through the Department of Education including this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.financialaidtoolkit.ed.gov/tk/&quot;&gt;toolkit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing local successes of FAFSA completion in Clark County (Nevada) were Kerry Bartlett, Mayra Galeana, and Jill Hersha. Clark County is the fifth largest school district in the country with over 318,000 students -- many of whom are in need of financial aid. In the 2012-2013 school year, the district provided 25 schools with FAFSA training, which resulted in a 34.5% completion rate. The following school year (2013-2014) the program expanded to 51 schools and the completion rate went up to 38%.A huge win for the district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The counselors were persistent with their students. They received more data, more frequently to help guide their engagement. Ongoing interaction with students and parents started at the beginning of the school year with various events like grade-level presentations, parent nights, computer lab opportunities, and college fairs.  As the key completion months approached (January – March), Jill Hersha focused on two simple questions for her students:  &lt;strong&gt;where are you at&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;what is stopping you from getting it done&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Brown closed the session by encouraging all attendees to put together a systemic plan to track FAFSA. “It is a great accountability metric and first step for getting more students into post-secondary education. It’s a key strategy that everyone should embrace.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;FAFSA Tracking: A Pathway to College Affordability and Student Access&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you come to the College Board Forum?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was asked to be part of a presentation, but I have also not been to Forum for quite a while so I wanted to start attending [again] because there is a lot of good information. I used to think it was more for those who were in K-12, and the recruiting aspect of higher education, but there is a lot of information about financial aid that you can obtain here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were some of the highlights of the Forum for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hear[ing] what other people had to say about what’s going on in higher education, and also [finding] new ideas on how to do things. My favorite thing was a session where they were talking about what “middle income” is versus “middle class,” and I really never thought about separating the two, but they really are two separate things. “Middle class” is more of an attitude, how people carry themselves, versus being tied to middle income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you going to bring back to your institution? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are trying to meet the needs of middle-income families, and I think we really need to sit down and get a clear definition of who should be a part of that middle-income family definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;3 Questions for Jackie Kennedy-Fletcher, Director of Financial Aid at Indiana University&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

We heard of many new and exciting updates for the upcoming 2017-18 Academic Year and beyond. Some of these changes are big and some of them are much smaller (but still super helpful)!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few of my biggest takeaways from the Conference:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reimagine CSS Profile is coming!&lt;/strong&gt; An updated CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE (CSS Profile) will be launching in the 2018-19 Year. This will make the process much more intuitive and student-friendly. Skip logic and an updated user experience will help students and families get through the application more quickly and with a better understanding of the process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Net Partner Updates! &lt;/strong&gt;For current college students, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/powerfaids/net-partner&quot;&gt;Net Partner&lt;/a&gt; is a critical tool for online communication between the financial aid office and students. These updates will allow students to have a much more dynamic experience with this tool and get the information they need quickly. It will also allow Financial Aid Offices to better target information to students. We can tell them what they need to know and not tell them anything that isn’t relevant to their situation!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PowerFAIDS improvements!&lt;/strong&gt; The PowerFAIDS software is being constantly updated to the latest FSA regulations and to the demand of our financial aid offices.  We will be getting some critical updates to allow for greater automation and streamlining of many crucial financial aid processes. While students may not see these improvements, they will allow aid officers to have more time working with students and less time wading through cumbersome processes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Aid Professionals want to help students!&lt;/strong&gt; Throughout the two-day conference and in all of the sessions, everything came back to a serious desire to help students! While financial aid is a critical part of the higher ed process, we realize that the end goal is not for students to spend all their time working with the Financial Aid Office. Everyone was sharing ideas about how best to serve students which I’m excited to bring s back to St. Olaf. I believe that we do a great job working with our student body – but there are always ways for us to make everything easier and more easily understood for the students!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, it was a great experience to be in San Diego and left me incredibly excited to implement these improvements on our campus and in the way we work with students and families!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Improvements and Excitement Abound at the 2017 PowerFAIDS Conference in San Diego&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Jeff Olson, who also presented for the Guidance and Admissions and Academic assemblies, gave financial aid professionals information about the College Board’s plan to improve the way the organization uses data, and the implications for financial aid in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Council chair Karen Cooper, director of financial aid at Stanford University, Chair-elect Jon McGee, Vice President for Planning and Public Affairs at College of St. Benedict and St. Johns University, and Past Chair Mary Nucciarone, director of financial aid at the University of Notre Dame sat down with All Access to discuss the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Access&lt;/strong&gt;: What are some takeaways from this meeting about the issues currently facing the financial aid community?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon McGee&lt;/strong&gt;: Right now, we’re all freaked out about “affordability” but none of us really know what that means. We need to use these meetings to talk about key issues in financial aid and affordability that have implications for the College Board, but also broad financial aid community. This meeting is a venue to convey the current work of the College Board to members, but also offers the opportunity for members to convey their important work to the College Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karen Cooper&lt;/strong&gt;: The assembly meetings allow us to think about where we want to take deeper dives during our upcoming National Council meetings. When we meet in December, one of the big things we will spend time talking about is how the College Board is reimagining PROFILE. Given the broad implications for financial aid in the next few years, reimagining PROFILE is an important project, and we encourage all members to be engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JM&lt;/strong&gt;: Because the Council meeting will be immediately post-election, we’ll also need to talk about the Higher Education Act reauthorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mary Nucciarone&lt;/strong&gt;: The information Jeff presented in particular offers an opportunity for us to learn about the financial aid pathways to our institutions, and better understand the experience of our students. The Khan Academy piece is a very important portal to expand access, especially because it would increase access to financial literacy resources. As financial aid professionals, one of our biggest responsibilities and challenges is to get people to understand college costs, and help them navigate the financial aid process successfully. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College Scholarship Service Assembly Meeting Addresses Pressing Issues in Financial Aid&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

As I stood for almost two hours giving out information to mostly 10th–12th-graders about planning for college, free SAT practice information, and college application fee waivers, I truly felt blessed to work for an organization with such a wonderful mission. At least 300 students and parents showed up at the event hoping to catch the admission and financial aid representatives from MIT, University of Arizona, and Maryland, among many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to several seniors, most of whom had already sent out their applications. One wanted to be a neonatal surgeon, another a journalist — many had clear pictures of what their futures should be.  A few didn’t yet know what they wanted out of college; they came to the event hoping to start figuring that out. The younger students seemed a little suspicious but pleasantly surprised when I kept saying the SAT practice online we offered was free. Parents, for their part, were in disbelief and promised they would make sure their kids took advantage of these free tools, which they had no idea existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the students wanted to go to college but worried about how they were going to find the money to pay for it.  Not surprisingly, the most popular sessions at Ballou that night were on financial aid. Several college representatives said how impressed they were with the engagement from students, who had come from three different schools in the area. Many students asked college representatives for their business cards so they could be in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With College Board Forum 2015 happening in Washington, D.C., it made sense to partner with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dcps.dc.gov/release/dc-public-schools-continues-momentum-fastest-improving-urban-school-district-country&quot;&gt;fastest-improving&lt;/a&gt; urban school district in the country to bring admission and financial aid experts from higher education institutions directly into contact with DCPS students,” said Aaron Lemon-Strauss, executive director at the College Board, who organized and executed the event.  “Colleges and universities are looking for engaged and prepared students, and Ballou, Anacostia, and Woodson high schools in D.C. have hundreds of them, as we saw last night.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though these events are meant to inspire students, I&#039;m happy to say that I, too, left inspired by such smart and driven students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;&amp;#039;Explore College&amp;#039; Night at Ballou High School Gets Rave Reviews by Staff and Students&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>Board of Trustees Unanimously Votes to Move to Prior-Prior Year for CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE</title>

This means that beginning with the 2017-18 financial aid cycle, PROFILE, the Institutional Need Analysis System (INAS), Institutional Methodology (IM), and the FAFSA, will all use prior-prior year tax information as the basis for assessing a family’s financial need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trustees were presented with information that addressed both the benefits and the potential challenges of moving to prior-prior year. This information was &lt;span&gt;prepared &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;by members from across the professional spectrum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;including the Financial Aid Standards and Services Advisory Committee (FASSAC), the College Scholarship Service Assembly Council (CSSAC), and the Guidance and Admission Assembly Council (GAAC). College Board staff also consulted closely with the counseling community, financial aid and enrollment leaders, and college access organizations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key to the Board decision is that using prior-prior year allows for a more streamlined and consistent financial aid application experience for students that aligns with the benefits of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/financial-aid/prior-prior-year-what-it-and-why-it-s-important-start-planning&quot;&gt;earlier FAFSA based on prior-prior year&lt;/a&gt;. Potential benefits include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A greater number of students will file aid applications, thus increasing the number of students obtaining aid for which they are eligible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Better information about paying for college will be available earlier in the college selection process, which will help students and families make more informed decisions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Institutions will start working under a more manageable financial aid processing schedule.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several considerations for institutions that will be critical to ensure a smooth transition, including a short timeline to adjust Institutional Methodology and accommodate new inputs, and potential impacts to institutional aid budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board is committed to supporting institutions through this transition to ensure that students fully benefit from this shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details about implementation steps and timelines will be communicated in the coming weeks as the College Board continues to consult with members&lt;strong&gt;.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;Trends in Higher Education&lt;/a&gt; series provides insight into national trends in college pricing and financial aid. The data on college prices and student aid included in these reports create a context for evaluating public policies designed to increase educational opportunities. Below are key findings from the reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandy Baum, research professor of education policy at the George Washington University Graduate School of Education &amp;amp; Human Development, senior fellow at the Urban Institute, and co-author of the 2014 Trends in Higher Education reports, will host a webinar for members on &lt;strong&gt;Thursday, Dec. 4, at 1–2 p.m&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; This webinar will include information about the results of both reports and discuss the implications for higher education and student aid moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://collegeboardtraining.webex.com/collegeboardtraining/onstage/g.php?MTID=eb87882e560855d28b66d96cd3283a63d&quot;&gt;Register&lt;/a&gt; for the webinar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Print versions of the report will be available at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://regionalforums.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;2015 Regional Forums&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Key Tuition and Fee Findings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Average published tuition and fees for full-time in-state students at public four-year colleges and universities increased 2.9%, rising from $8,885 in 2013-14 to $9,139 in 2014-15.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Average published tuition and fees for full-time out-of-state students at public four-year colleges and universities increased 3.3%, rising from $22,223 in 2013-14 to $22,958 in 2014-15.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Average published tuition and fees at private nonprofit four-year institutions increased 3.7%, rising from $30,131 in 2013-14 to $31,231 in 2014-15.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Average published in-district tuition and fees at public two-year colleges increased 3.3%, rising from $3,241 in 2013-14 to $3,347 in 2014-15.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Average net prices are much lower than published prices because many students benefit from grant aid from federal and state governments, colleges and universities, and other sources, as well as from federal education tax credits and deductions. Over the decade from 2004-05 to 2014-15, average net tuition and fees at public four-year institutions rose by 32%, compared to a 42% increase in the published price (after adjusting for inflation). At private nonprofit four-year institutions, the average net price fell by 13% over the decade, while the average published price increased by 24%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2014-15, full-time students receive an average of about $6,110 in grant aid and education tax benefits at public four-year institutions, $5,090 at public two-year colleges, and $18,870 at private nonprofit four-year institutions to help them pay the published prices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Key Student Aid Findings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Undergraduates received an average of $14,180 in financial aid in 2013-14, including $8,080 in grants from all sources, $4,840 in federal loans, $1,195 in education tax credits and deductions, and $65 in Federal Work-Study.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Total annual education borrowing fell by an estimated 8% in real terms between 2012-13 and 2013-14, following declines of 4% and 2% in the two preceding years, leading to a three-year decline of 13%.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2013-14, undergraduate borrowers took federal Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans averaging $6,670, over $300 less (in 2013 dollars) than the year before and $740 less than in 2010-11.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Total borrowing from the federal direct subsidized and unsubsidized loan programs fell by an estimated 10% ($8.7 billion in 2013 dollars) in 2013-14, and by 18% between 2010-11 and 2013-14. Total borrowing under the Parent PLUS program fell by 1% ($58 million) in 2013-14 and by 12% over three years; and the Grad PLUS program provided 4% ($276 million) less in 2013-14 than in the preceding year and 1% more than in 2010-11.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2013, 40% of borrowers with outstanding education debt owed less than $10,000, and another 29% owed between $10,000 and $24,999; 4% of borrowers owed $100,000 or more. This debt includes borrowing for both undergraduate and graduate studies.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grant aid per full-time equivalent undergraduate student increased by 39% between 2007-08 and 2010-11 and by 8% between 2010-11 and 2013-14.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The number of students receiving Pell Grants — the central federal grant program providing funding for low- and moderate-income students — increased from 3.8 million in 1993-94 to 5.1 million in 2003-04, and to 9.2 million in 2013-14. The percentage of undergraduate students receiving Pell Grants increased from 25% in 2003-04 to 38% in 2013-14.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;Trends in Higher Education&lt;/a&gt; reports were written by College Board Policy Research Scientist Jennifer Ma, and Sandy Baum, research professor of education policy at the George Washington University Graduate School of Human Development, with assistance from College Board Research Statistician D’Wayne Bell and Diane Cardenas Elliott.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College Board Releases the 2014 Trends in Higher Education Reports&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Read the full statement below. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December 15, 2015&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An Open Letter to the Education Community&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As representatives of counselors, higher education administrators and state aid programs, we applaud the bipartisan support for the use of prior-prior-year income information (PPY) on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Federal data show that 2 million students already in college fail to file the FAFSA each year, as do 1 million graduating high school seniors, especially from low-income school districts. A simple goal to address this problem: make accessing federal student aid easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, the Obama Administration announced two major changes slated for the FAFSA: first, that PPY income (2015 tax year data) will be used to determine federal aid eligibility for the 2017-18 school year and second, that the 2017-18 FAFSA will be available to students on October 1, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are committed to supporting a successful transition to PPY to ensure our collective memberships understand and support the goals of PPY. Through early FAFSA, students and families will have more time to consider their aid eligibility potentially at the same time many are searching for, applying to, and even selecting colleges - ideally allowing students and families more time to consider their enrollment choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also recognize that the availability of the FAFSA in October has the potential to create significant changes in the college application and admissions process. Together, we encourage colleges and universities and all organizations who serve our students to work towards the goal of PPY to allow students more time to plan and, ultimately, to make informed enrollment decisions. Adhering to this objective, including the preservation of the May 1 decision deadline, is critical to making this important policy change a success for students and institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are committed to working closely with the U.S. Department of Education&#039;s Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) to ensure our professionals are prepared to assist students and families with this change. In the coming weeks, we will be working closely with each other and with FSA to provide information and resources to our constituent members to help answer the numerous questions pertaining to PPY implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

The Colloquium is a gathering of professionals at all levels of higher education to discuss the topics and issues that matter most to them and their students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luna, a first generation college student, kicked off the conversations for the next two days with a keynote address that focused on what public education means to the common good. At a time when policy makers and the general public alike are questioning the value of higher education, Luna described the imperative of all higher education stakeholders to disseminate a common understanding that education is the key to choice, independence, and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He challenged participants to consider the following question: Does higher education as a holistic institution truly care about all students?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Colloquium, attendees will bring this question to bear as they discuss the most salient issues in higher education right now—including how college costs are affecting the middle class, communications strategies around the value of a college education, and the debate surrounding college rankings and ratings systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luna’s own college experience continues to inform his work to this day. He shared anecdotes about his time as an undergraduate at Stanford, which was not without setbacks. His message that the shifting demographics of this country necessitate a continuous shift in the approach of higher education institutions to serving and supporting all students set the tone for the next few days, and energized participants to prepare for these tough conversations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Paul Luna Challenges Colloquium 2015 Participants to Rethink their Approach to Serving All Students &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>Members in the News: In tough times, colleges turn to unconventional leaders</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When tiny Paul Quinn College faced its darkest hour, it turned not to a physicist or an historian or a political scientist to lead it forward. It named a corporate securities lawyer and crisis manager as its president.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The historically black college in Dallas, Texas, brought in Michael Sorrell in 2007 to turn around a school in such dire financial straits that it was on its way to losing accreditation. Eight years later, the unorthodox thinking that made Sorrell the hope of Paul Quinn’s board of trustees – and Sorrell understood that board because he had served on it – has turned the school around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trustees figured traditional leaders had brought Paul Quinn to its knees. Why not hand the reins to someone who had not spent a career in academia?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you have to go through a transformation like our school did, there are pros to bringing in someone from outside your industry,” said trustee Don Clevenger, who was appointed shortly after Sorrell was hired. “He brings more of a business attitude than would someone looking at it primarily from an educational perspective.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Financial pressures, growing public scrutiny and other problems are prompting colleges and universities to turn to new types of leaders who didn’t rise up the ranks as academics, as was the longstanding tradition. Instead, they’ve turned to politicians, lawyers, civil servants and even military officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these unconventional presidents, in turn, are bringing with them new ideas and sudden changes that have jolted the slow-moving world of higher education — often to the ire of the people who inhabit that world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Iowa in September appointed a former IBM executive, J. Bruce Harreld, a specialist in corporate turnarounds, for example. In October, the University of North Carolina system hired former Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings as president. She is scheduled to take office in March, but protesters angry over her corporate ties already&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/community/chapel-hill-news/article49198630.html&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(55, 123, 218); outline: 0px;&quot;&gt; are asking that she be fired&lt;/a&gt;. At least three schools — Mansfield University in Pennsylvania, Georgia Gwinnett College and Alabama’s Birmingham-Southern College — brought in former military officers as president, although two have since left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this recent spate of nonacademic hirings, only about one in 10 U.S. college and university presidents came directly from a nonacademic job, according to 2012 figures from the American Council on Education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That number is likely to rise, said Peter Eckel, who directs leadership programs at the University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education. The country simply hasn’t done enough to prepare academics to lead colleges and universities, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing boards looking more seriously at a range of candidates,” Eckel said. “That’s partly because the pipeline is not real robust right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, new ways of thinking can reinvigorate a stagnant or troubled campus, as Sorrell did at Paul Quinn. On the other hand, those campuses can be powder kegs of self-interested constituencies, and outsiders sometimes encounter suspicion and outright hostility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take Harreld, whose hiring at Iowa was criticized immediately by faculty members who voiced concern that he did not understand higher education. The American Association of University Professors in December released a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/IowaInvestigation.pdf&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(55, 123, 218); outline: 0px;&quot;&gt;scathing report&lt;/a&gt; contending Harreld had been hired despite faculty concerns that he was dramatically unqualified for the role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience illustrates the tricky balancing act characterizing college presidencies. Presidents must appease the trustees who hired them by attracting donations and academic notoriety, but also must inspire confidence among employees wary of dramatic changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite coming to Paul Quinn with the intent to transform the school, Sorrell has managed to avoid major missteps. Concerned by the college’s tattered finances and falling enrollment, Sorrell disbanded the football team and turned the field into a farm in an attempt to turn around the “food desert” of Paul Quinn’s poverty-stricken surroundings, with students leading the farming, business plans and marketing. He hopes to turn the school into a model for how institutions can bring healthy food to poor neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The college, once down to its last few dollars after a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/archive/usao/txn/PressRel08/fantroy_sen_pr.html&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(55, 123, 218); outline: 0px;&quot;&gt;trustee embezzled thousands&lt;/a&gt; from the school, has bounced back with large annual budget surpluses. And Sorrell, dismayed after his arrival by the pajamas and sweats worn by students, instituted a business casual dress code on campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, Sorrell announced a slew of other changes, including the addition of several new majors, cheaper textbooks and a “work college” model that will discount tuition for students who work on campus for two years and then at a participating company for the final two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of students at the Christian college has since rebounded, to 425, after plummetting from 550 in 2007 to about 150 in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A supportive board and staff is essential for innovation, Sorrell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It would have been really easy for them to be skittish,” said Sorrell, who said he decided as an Oberlin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College undergraduate that he wanted to be a college president (although he also counts cabinet secretary and NBA team owner among his goals). “We proposed some pretty outlandish things. The farm was one of those things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was pretty clear upon Sorrell’s arrival that faculty members were worried about the changes to come, said Clevenger, the Paul Quinn trustee. After all, this was a guy who had spent the past few years doing crisis management for NBA players, not roaming a college campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think early on they spoke different languages,” Clevenger said. “There was friction, as you might imagine. As he’s remade the school, that has been ironed over.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although skepticism about outsiders continues, there are some success stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of California, for example, struggled under state budget cuts when it brought in Janet Napolitano, a former Department of Homeland Security secretary and Arizona governor, in 2013 to lead the 10-campus system. Her political savvy as she butted heads with Gov. Jerry Brown has led to the restoration of some state money after years of budget cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, named president of Purdue in 2013, has mostly managed to avoid controversy even as he’s trimmed costs and pushed a new kind of financial-aid tool called income-share agreements that could replace loans for some students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presidents from academic backgrounds are innovating, too, said Eckel and other education experts, and trying new strategies to attract students and donors during a particularly tumultuous time in higher education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Northern Arizona University and the University of Maine at Presque Isle, for example, seasoned administrators Rita Cheng and Linda Schott, respectively, have been willing to push the boundaries of competency-based education, which allows older students to use life experience to earn degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re at a turning point,” Eckel said. “There’s a lot of presidents who are saying, ‘This is the time to try new things.’ “Good boards are going to be supportive of innovation and allow presidents to take risks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risks are the only way to fend off arguments about such things as high college costs and low success rates, Sorrell said, and sometimes an outsider is the best person to take them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know what’s not possible,” he said. “If I had come from higher education, I might have looked at Paul Quinn College and said, ‘This is impossible.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said: “It’s not that I’m amazing. It’s just that no one else took the job.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attended last year and learned an enormous amount. I think it’s a great opportunity to get reenergized about the core of what we do. Over the course of the year we get caught up in the semantics of our day to day jobs and it’s wonderful to be reminded of the purpose and mission of our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We just heard from panelists about the importance of communicating about the price of college. As a financial aid professional, talk about your reaction to &lt;a href=&quot;https://colloquium.collegeboard.org/program&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this session&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m surprised by how infrequently communications comes up in terms of student aid access. I was also surprised by how much frustration there is around aid communications, but I understand why it exists, especially when you look at the resources colleges devote to admissions communications, or policy maker communications. It’s striking to think that aid officers feel so badly under-resourced in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we feel like it is somehow crass to message around aid, but the reality is, it’s a public service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools that do cost communications best, in terms of ease of use and presentation, are for-profit institutions and tuition-dependent small colleges, and that’s because they have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially for those of us at an institution with a public service mission as a core part of our identity, we have to start looking at aid communications in that context. Done right, it’s a service to students and families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you end up working in higher education?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to work for Shirley Ort, who is one of the true believers in the core mission of higher education. I met Shirley when I was a student journalist at UNC and she was one of the most consistently open and helpful people in higher ed. I was lucky enough to work with her on some one-off projects after graduation, and now I get to work with her full time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working for Shirley has been a great chance to learn the ins and outs of a very complicated an increasingly important corner of higher ed—and there was no way I was going to miss out on that chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you had a piece of advice or encouragement for someone thinking about pursuing a career in higher education, particularly in the financial aid arena, what would it be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial aid is the most fascinating areas of public policy to me. It is one of the most complex and politically contentious public benefits and in that sense it is a great place to gain experience to pursue a career in politics, public affairs, economics—it is widely applicable no matter where you see your career going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s valuable about Colloquium, in particular, compared to other higher education conferences?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colloquium is much more conversational, and a little rawer than most higher education conferences I’ve been to. In that sense, it’s more productive. I would say there is more honesty in the way people are talking to each other, and I hope some of that spills over into our public discussions of these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Overheard at Colloquium: Attendee Eric Johnson Talks Communications and Financial Aid&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

A remarkably even cross-section of counselors, financial aid professionals, and admission officers gathered to hear colleagues discuss the implementation strategy for prior-prior year and its potential challenges over the next several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Ball, associate vice president for enrollment management at Bradley University; Diane Corbett, executive director of student financial aid at The Ohio State University; and Brad Lindberg, director of student financial aid at Grinnell College, joined Anne Sturtevant, the College Board’s executive director of higher education initiatives, to address the many questions that colleges, counselors, and students are asking about prior-prior year. Among them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How will this change affect professional judgment and how aid officers approach students with special circumstances?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How will students’ enrollment behavior change as a result of having more financial aid information earlier?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can institutions leverage these opportunities for change to most benefit students and families?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the practical implications for campus visits, early decision deadlines, and tuition setting?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When should counselors start communicating the changes to students?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there may not be clear answers to all these questions yet, the session provided a space for important discussion about these major considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two parts to prior-prior year: the early availability of the FAFSA (available in October as opposed to January) and families’ ability to report income information from the two previous years. In practice, this means that students will receive earlier information about their financial aid packages and be able to make decisions about where they go to college with that information in-hand. The College Board also recently announced that the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE will accept prior-prior year income information as the base year for applying for institutional aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we think about this from the perspective of students and families, all of a sudden the timeline makes a lot more sense,” said Corbett. “These students and families will now be able to gather all their information and file the FAFSA in October. This is a tremendous opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutions will need to take a hard look at their admission and business practices and policies, and consider making significant shifts in their admission and operational timelines. While this may bring about challenges for institutions, it also brings significant opportunity to disrupt the “business as usual” mentality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session ended with questions from the audience, and Sturtevant reiterated that the College Board will continue to communicate consistently with stakeholders and offer opportunities for counselors, admission officers, students, and financial aid professionals as they navigate the unchartered waters of prior-prior year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Prior-Prior Year’s Impact on Student Financial Aid and Admission&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>College Board Announces Major Expansion in Access to Scholarships for the Millions of Students Who Take the PSAT/NMSQT®</title>

The American Indian Graduate Center and American Indian Graduate Center Scholars (AIGC and AIGCS), Asian &amp;amp; Pacific Islander American Scholarship Fund (APIASF), Hispanic Scholarship Fund (HSF), Jack Kent Cooke Foundation (JKCF), and the United Negro College&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fund (UNCF) will use information from the PSAT/NMSQT&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to expand access to nearly $180 million in existing scholarship dollars to low-income and minority students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PSAT/NMSQT information will allow AIGC and AIGCS, APIASF, HSF, the JKCF, and UNCF to reach a better representation of high school students across the country who may not have otherwise been aware they were eligible for scholarship opportunities. Outreach will begin with students from the class of 2015 who have taken the PSAT/NMSQT during high school and opted in to receive materials from scholarship providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PSAT/NMSQT is the nation’s largest and most representative precollege assessment. In October 2014, a record 3.8 million students took the exam. As a result of the College Board’s ongoing efforts to expand access to the PSAT/NMSQT to a broader group of students, 77 percent (897,567) of minority students who graduated from public high schools in 2014 took the PSAT/NMSQT at least once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement reinforces the College Board’s commitment to making assessments a platform for delivering opportunity. These new partnerships, combined with the College Board’s long-standing partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalmerit.org/&quot;&gt;National Merit Scholarship Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (NMSC), create a portfolio of opportunities that reach every major segment of students. The scholarships will now range from programs focused purely on academic merit, to those available to students who meet specific financial, racial, ethnic, and other eligibility requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What this country needs is not more tests but more opportunities,” said David Coleman, president and CEO of the College Board. “The 3.8 million students who already take the PSAT/NMSQT will now gain access to nearly $180 million more in scholarships, early enough in their high school careers to change their futures. These partnerships complement our work with National Merit Scholarship Corporation, and further remove barriers to college and career success for students across the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the College Board launched a redesign of the PSAT/NMSQT. Like the redesigned SAT, the redesigned PSAT/NMSQT will be focused on the skills and knowledge evidence shows is necessary for success in college and career. The first administration of the exam will take place in October 2015.  In addition to scholarship opportunities, additional benefits of the current and redesigned PSAT/NMSQT include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Practice for the SAT;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A mid-high school check on whether a student is on target for college and career readiness;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detailed performance feedback and suggestions for how students can improve their readiness for college and career, including free, personalized SAT practice through Khan Academy;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Access to challenging course work by identifying students’ potential to succeed in Advanced Placement courses; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Access to free college and career planning resources such as Student Search Service®, My College QuickStart™, and BigFuture™.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Statements from the New Partners&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P. “Sam” Deloria, Director, AIGC&lt;/strong&gt;: “Since our founding, AIGC and AIGCS have been driven by a commitment to expand the number of American Indians  who earn professional degrees. We recognize how critical financial support is to ensuring students can pursue postsecondary opportunities, and working with the College Board allows us to reach a broader group of American Indian students who can take advantage of the scholarships we offer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neil Horikoshi, President and Executive Director, APIASF&lt;/strong&gt;: “Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) students are often left out of the conversation when it comes to intervention for college access and success. We are thankful for partners like the College Board, who recognize the need and are helping us inform AAPI students about resources they have to pursue a college education.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fidel A. Vargas, President and CEO, HSF&lt;/strong&gt;: “Our goal is to provide students all the tools they need to apply to college, do well in their course work, graduate, enter a profession, excel, help lead our nation going forward, and mentor the generations to come. Working with the College Board is yet another way we will be able to further our goals and help Latino students make successful transitions to college.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harold O. Levy, Executive Director, JKCF: &lt;/strong&gt;“The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation awards annual scholarships of up to $40,000 to high-performing students with financial need. By partnering with the College Board, we are able to engage a broader universe of high-achieving, low-income students that have the ability to excel when given the resources to develop their talents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael L. Lomax, President and CEO, UNCF&lt;/strong&gt;: “For 70 years, UNCF has worked to help students get to and through college. Partnering with the College Board will allow us to further expand our reach to African American students across the country who will benefit from being able to access the scholarships and resources we are prepared to provide.”&lt;/p&gt;

Read the official statement from the university below or on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://source.wustl.edu/2016/03/ronne-patrick-turner-named-vice-provost-for-admissions/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ronné Patrick Turner, associate vice president of enrollment and dean of admission at Northeastern University, has been appointed vice provost for admissions at Washington University in St. Louis, effective July 1, according to Chancellor Mark S. Wrighton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turner succeeds John Berg, who announced in October that he would retire from the position June 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We could not be more pleased that our national search for our next leader in undergraduate admissions has led us to Ronné Turner,” Wrighton said. “She is an accomplished professional with a proven record of success in not only recruiting top students, but also ensuring that they are prepared to meet and exceed their goals throughout their college careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I also am extremely grateful to John Berg, who in his nearly 30 years of service — 22 of which were spent leading our admissions efforts — has overseen a significant increase in both the number and quality of applicants to Washington University. He leaves a remarkable legacy and a strong foundation for our next chapter under Ronné’s leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her new role, Turner will be responsible for planning and directing the recruitment of undergraduate students to Washington University and for implementing strategies to increase the strength and diversity of the student body. She also will oversee Student Financial Services, which is dedicated to making it financially possible for admitted students to enroll and for enrolled students to graduate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turner comes to Washington University after nearly 15 years at Northeastern, where she leads and directs undergraduate admission and enrollment for the university’s seven colleges and oversees the development and implementation of recruitment and enrollment strategies to meet objectives for freshman, transfer and international students. She also serves on the university’s Enrollment Strategy Committee, which is focused on scholarship and financial aid; and oversees the Opportunity Scholarship unit, which admits and supports approximately 75 first-generation students receiving a range of scholarship aid each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ronné brings the right mix of talent, skill and administrative experience to this critical role,” Provost Holden Thorp said. “As each incoming class becomes more accomplished and excellent in every respect, we are tremendously fortunate to have found the perfect leader to help us maximize the opportunity that is in front of us — to raise the bar, reimagine the possibilities and cultivate the next generation of Washington University students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am thrilled to join the Washington University team and to contribute to the university’s continued enrollment success,” Turner said. “I look forward to working with the entire university community to attract and enroll outstanding students from diverse backgrounds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to joining the Northeastern administration in 2001, Turner had worked for more than a decade at the University of Maryland, College Park, where she served in roles including admission counselor, assistant director for freshman admission, and associate director for admission marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turner also worked as an assistant director of admissions at her alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, where she earned her bachelor’s degree in social and behavioral science. She also earned a master’s degree in social foundations of education from the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among her professional associations, Turner serves on the Board of Trustees of the College Board and as chair of the National Guidance and Admission Assembly, and she has held positions with the College Board New England Regional Association and the National Association for College Admission Counseling. She was honored in 2011 with the Northeastern University Innovation Award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>College and University Presidents Discuss Higher Ed’s Role in Serving the Public Good</title>

&lt;p&gt;That was the overarching message participants at the Higher Ed Colloquium received from the “Conversation with Presidents” that opened the first full day of events On January 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in Delray Beach, FL. Following Paul Luna’s keynote the previous evening, during which he challenged the audience of higher education professionals to address the needs of &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; students, the session invited a careful and critical look into how individual student populations may influence institutional policy and culture rather than the other way around. Catharine Bond Hill, Wallace D. Loh, and Michael A. Sorrell, presidents of Vassar College, the University of Maryland, and Paul Quinn College, respectively, each offered ideas and advice that, though sometimes seemingly at odds, have contributed significantly to the success of their particular institution – success defined largely by their ability to produce graduates who are both employable and civic-minded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Montoya, the College Board’s vice president for higher education and international outreach, asked the panel a broad but daunting question: “How do colleges and universities need to step it up?”  It turns out that the different answers the presidents gave were shaped by a shared goal: to do what is best for the communities they serve.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For President Sorrell, that means placing a very conscious effort on confronting the issues that most directly affect the low-income students in his care.  And in their case, he says, their lives will be changed most by changing the urban environment in which they live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve decided to marry education with the public good, treat it as its own educational endeavor,” said Sorrell. “The public good occurs when you actually weigh into the issues and solve them. The needs of the community supersede the individual.”  As an example, Sorrell highlighted the dismantling of Paul Quinn’s football program and the transformation of its football field into an organic urban farm that now serves the local community, otherwise classified as a food desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation and entrepreneurship for the sake of the public good was also a theme of President Loh’s remarks. Loh likewise singled out a nutrition-related project at the University of Maryland, the Food Recovery Network, which provides food that would otherwise go to waste to people in need. But innovation and entrepreneurship should be the watchwords of the university, said Loh, primarily to solve “the biggest issue of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century: jobs, jobs, jobs.” At a large economically diverse institution like the University of Maryland, he argued, it is imperative to conceive of ways to educate everyone better, and at a lower cost for the more financially strapped. “Why are the low income students subsidizing the wealthy?” he asked. “I think we should raise tuition to help the low income students. Institutions must have autonomy [to make these decisions].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Hill warned that increasing income inequality will lead to problems greater than personal student debt. The likelihood that students from low income families will have access to educational opportunity at all, she said, is becoming ever more doubtful.  As a result, “I think we’ll see social stresses that will make this a country we don’t want to live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How can we make sure higher ed is part of the solution, and not reinforcing societal problems?” Hill asked.  “How do we frame this argument at the local level to get our states to reinvest in our students education as part of the public good?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hill agreed that serving one’s students and serving the larger good are not mutually exclusive, and, in fact, that you can’t do one without the other. “We have on obligation, even as a private institution, to serve the public interest,” she said.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College and University Presidents Discuss Higher Ed’s Role in Serving the Public Good&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
