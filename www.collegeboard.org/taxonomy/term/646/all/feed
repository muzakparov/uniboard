All Access is a new space for College Board members to read news and best practices from colleagues around the country, learn about developments in College Board programs and services, access important resources, and share their own news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As summer begins, we’re looking forward to an opportunity to take a step back and examine what truly effects change for our students. At the College Board, we are working diligently to deliver high-quality educational opportunities for all students. Our members are our partners in this effort, and your input and feedback is invaluable to us as we continue to develop programs and resources to help you in your day-to-day work. We believe All Access will be a unique collaborative tool that will connect educators from all spheres — from K–12 to higher education and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Access is easy to read on your computer, tablet, or mobile phone, and members can filter the news they see on their feed by professional area, subject keyword, or region. The “Submit Your Own News” button makes it easy to share news and best practices, and members can engage with each other directly through the commenting function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content featured in All Access will continue to evolve, and we will use reader feedback to best serve the needs of our members. If you are interested in learning more about All Access, please contact Abby Hexter, assistant director of member communications, at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:ahexter@collegeboard.org&quot;&gt;ahexter@collegeboard.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Welcome to College Board: All Access&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It’s an exciting time of year for me and my team as we prepare for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.collegeboard.org&quot;&gt;College Board Forum&lt;/a&gt;.  I wanted to take the opportunity to thank our members for being our partners in delivering more opportunities to the students we serve. It is through the passion and dedication of our members in partnership with College Board staff that we can be the catalyst to ensure that all students who work hard are able to go and succeed in college. While this will be my fifth Forum, it will be the first one in my new role leading the membership team. And the College Board Forum is a top priority for my team.  My goal is to ensure that the event will continue to support and inform the work of our members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who will be attending Forum, I hope you will leave the conference with new techniques and expanded knowledge that will serve you and your students well. And in addition to breakout sessions, we’re so excited to bring you four plenary sessions which feature a wide range of distinguished speakers including Sal Khan, John Quinones, Janet Napolitano, and Mae Jameson. For those members unable to attend, be sure to visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access&quot;&gt;All Access&lt;/a&gt; for updates, videos and interviews from Forum. You can also follow along on social media by searching&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; hashtag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;#CBForum14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/thecollegeboard&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;following us on Twitter at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://noreply.collegeboard.org/1498740c1layfousiaqklofyaaaaaacqsp6sqt47mdayaaaaa&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;@CB_Forums&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with hashtag &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;#CBForum14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your unwavering commitment to serving our nation’s students, and for all the work you do that propels them forward. Your work is truly inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Barbara Cronan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We honor the key role you play in the lives of aspiring students. We’re excited to share College Board: All Access, our newest communications tool to help better connect K-12 and Higher Ed members to the College Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our New England Regional members are among the finest seasoned and emerging leaders in secondary and post-secondary education. Together, we want to help one another learn and grow in the profession and help propel the students we serve into opportunities that they have earned. We want to extend our ongoing invitation to partner with you in your important work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fall, we have already coordinated several convenings for our members including the very successful &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/higher-ed/financial-aid/institute-financial-aid&quot;&gt;2014 Financial Aid Institute&lt;/a&gt;. The New England Team was able to reach nearly 1,400 school counselors at &lt;a href=&quot;https://counselorworkshops.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;workshops&lt;/a&gt; held throughout New England since the start of the school year. We are also hosting webinars and other informational sessions on the redesigned SAT. More information on the new SAT can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;collegereadiness.collegeboard.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the College Board released program results for the class of 2014, which shows that New England’s students are high performers on the PSAT/NMSQT, Advanced Placement, and SAT. Participation rates and SAT scores were among the highest in the nation in several New England states.  And, four out of the six New England states were above the national average in Advanced Placement in both participation and performance, a real testament to providing students access and the support they need to succeed. Your New England based-team is working with educators throughout our region by providing effective tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/start-grow-ap/grow-ap/ap-potential&quot;&gt;AP Potential&lt;/a&gt; so that students who exhibit potential for more challenging course work are identified and provided the opportunities AP courses offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the College Board, thank you for all that you do to support students so that they have the opportunity to pursue a post-secondary education. Together, we can deliver opportunity to countless students throughout our region, the country, and the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to bringing you up to date information from the New England region on All Access, and I encourage all members in the region to share their own news with College Board membership by clicking &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/all-access/submit-article&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;News from New England’s Regional Vice President and Regional Council Chair&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Topics of discussion included access to opportunity; how data can support efforts to encourage students with academic potential to apply to four or more colleges; and how the College Board can more effectively blend instruction with assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Thinking about community colleges, it’s all about access, affordability and achievement,” said Council chair-elect Michael McDonough, Provost and Vice President for Academic Services at Monroe Community College. “Data may help the access and achievement pieces, but can also help identify where students are losing momentum on a journey that for some of them might be very lengthy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McDonough added that data can also serve as an identifier of where and why students may be losing momentum on their path to college, including: adequate access to academic, financial, and counseling support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Data makes opportunity real,” said McDonough. “For those of us in postsecondary education, that’s one of the big uses of data; there’s some controversy in my part of the world about the phrase ‘under-matching,’ but let’s instead understand that students’ individual pathways to their achievement might be multi-institutional for good reason.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Council Chair Pam Paulson, Senior Director of Policy at the Perpich Center for Arts and Education discussed how new College Board instruction and assessment programs are working to combat “testing exhaustion” by offering students and educators early feedback to help them improve over time. Paulson encouraged the College Board to continue thinking of ways to support this momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think there’s exhaustion from standardized testing for students and their parents, and the new initiatives we’re undertaking – like 6-12 and AP Capstone – help us move from tests that record achievement at one point in time to formative assessments that address some of the preparation issues,” said Paulson. “Because it gives the students a chance to improve when they get feedback and get remediation early before they move on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McDonough noted that 63 percent of new students at his institution enter needing remedial work, underscoring Paulson’s point that the College Board should continue to work on programs that offer robust student feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One of the strengths of the College Board is the ability to convene a broad array of stakeholders,” said McDonough. “The College Board has a tremendous currency as a convener of stakeholders. I hope people understand that the mission of the College Board is for all students. We can be a very powerful agent for change.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Academic Assembly Focuses on Data and Momentum&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Dr. Joyce Brown is a leader in implementing FAFSA tracking programs across the country. These programs were built from pilot programs started in the Chicago Public School system. “When you get FAFSA done, magic happens,” said Brown when sharing key strategies for getting more students to complete their forms. Brown mentioned that counselors must be engaged in a way that transforms practices into outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although FAFSA completion rates are going up, we have lots of work to do. There is a national focus from President Obama and the First Lady with her &lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/reach-higher&quot;&gt;Reach Higher initiative&lt;/a&gt;. The Department of Education can now provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://studentaid.ed.gov/about/data-center/student/application-volume/fafsa-completion-high-school&quot;&gt;state-level completion data&lt;/a&gt; that districts and counselors can use to engage with students in meaningful ways. Key strategies include data cleaning, encouraging the creation of pin numbers, training events for counselors, completion events and workshops and close tracking of progress. There are great resources available through the Department of Education including this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.financialaidtoolkit.ed.gov/tk/&quot;&gt;toolkit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing local successes of FAFSA completion in Clark County (Nevada) were Kerry Bartlett, Mayra Galeana, and Jill Hersha. Clark County is the fifth largest school district in the country with over 318,000 students -- many of whom are in need of financial aid. In the 2012-2013 school year, the district provided 25 schools with FAFSA training, which resulted in a 34.5% completion rate. The following school year (2013-2014) the program expanded to 51 schools and the completion rate went up to 38%.A huge win for the district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The counselors were persistent with their students. They received more data, more frequently to help guide their engagement. Ongoing interaction with students and parents started at the beginning of the school year with various events like grade-level presentations, parent nights, computer lab opportunities, and college fairs.  As the key completion months approached (January – March), Jill Hersha focused on two simple questions for her students:  &lt;strong&gt;where are you at&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;what is stopping you from getting it done&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Brown closed the session by encouraging all attendees to put together a systemic plan to track FAFSA. “It is a great accountability metric and first step for getting more students into post-secondary education. It’s a key strategy that everyone should embrace.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;FAFSA Tracking: A Pathway to College Affordability and Student Access&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

A big question on the minds of K12 and higher ed member leaders alike was: what does PPY mean for students?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions among representatives from the College Board’s three national councils—Academic, Guidance and Admission, and College Scholarship Service—and six regional councils ranged from tackling the implications of prior-prior year for admissions and financial aid, to determining the future of membership and governance at the College Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlights include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The College Scholarship Service Assembly Council discussed the implications of PPY, and planned a 2-pronged approach. Step 1: gather and sift information from institutions, schools, and nonprofit organizations; Step 2: interpret that information and take action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Guidance and Admission Assembly Council addressed the implications specifically for the class of 2017, prior-prior year, the redesigned SAT, and the Coalition Application are just some of the major changes for this class.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Academic Assembly Council focused on establishing a connection between the College Board’s work in instruction and assessment. By leveraging technology to meet more frequently, the AAC can address issues in both areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All members identified a need to continue the discussion on PPY; its benefits for students, and implications for high schools and colleges. The College Board will continue to engage its members in these discussions, including during Assembly meetings at the upcoming National Forum in Washington, DC. &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.collegeboard.org/registration&quot;&gt;Register now to be part of the conversation!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;PPY Among Discussion Topics at College Board Joint Council Meeting&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Ericka will lead our overall work in Membership, Governance, and Higher Education, ensuring effective integration and collaboration among these critical divisions. By uniting these teams under Ericka’s leadership, we are better positioned to work together with our members across our constituencies, achieve our goals, and propel students into opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericka brings to the College Board a wealth of experience and a track record of delivering access and opportunity to students. Throughout her career, she has taken on complex, highly visible projects and worked with a range of stakeholders to deliver results. She has managed large teams across many disciplines, including strategic planning, public policy development and advocacy, executive recruitment, and fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericka joins the College Board from the U.S. Department of Education, where she served as Senior Advisor to Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. In that role, she led cross-agency teams working on issues that included higher education funding and grant-making. Prior to her work at the Department, Ericka served as the Vice President for Operations and Strategic Leadership for The Education Trust, a renowned national education nonprofit. As chief operating officer for Ed Trust, she ensured the effective development and implementation of a 10-year strategic plan, led a comprehensive board development process, and guided the organization through a significant period of growth, which included the establishment of a new state office and three supporting organizations. Under her leadership, Ed Trust was recognized as a &lt;em&gt;Great Place to Work&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Washingtonian&lt;/em&gt; magazine. Other previous roles included Vice President and Director at the executive search firm Isaacson, Miller, where she led the K-12 education practice, and the McKenzie Group (now part of American Institutes for Research), where she served as President and COO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericka earned her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University and her master’s and doctoral degrees in English literature from Stanford University. She is a former English professor at Mills College in Oakland where she taught American literature and persuasive writing. Ericka was born and raised in Alexandria, Va., and still considers the T. C. Williams Titans her favorite sports team. She enjoys active travel, community service, and following the teenage adventures of her twin nephews.&lt;/p&gt;

All former College Board trustees who wish to continue to collaborate with the organization are invited to be members of the Oak Circle. Gordon Stanley, Director of College Counseling at Webb School of Knoxville in Knoxville, Tennessee and founding Chair of the Oak Circle, says that the group was created to keep former trustees engaged with the College Board “so that their rich experiences could continue to be used productively, but differently, than when they served as trustees.” Gordon is pleased to now have over 40 former trustees as Oak Circle members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the group’s launch in 2013, Oak Circle members have served as program planning committee members for College Board events, presented during the Enrollment Leadership Academy, served on committees for College Board’s recognition programs, and recently were assigned as mentors to the winners of the College Board’s new Fellowship Program. Gordon also touts   the Oak Circle’s participation in hosting the New Attendee Welcome session at the College Board &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;National Forum&lt;/a&gt; for the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this year’s Forum, Gordon will be cycling off as Chair of the Oak Circle, handing the post over to Leo Munson, Associate Provost at Texas Christian University. Leo has served on the Oak Circle Advisory Committee for the past three years and has a strong passion for the work that the Oak Circle leads. Upon reflection of his time on the Advisory, Leo shares, “It is not often that friends and colleagues are asked to create a mission and vision for a new organization. I am pleased that I played a small part in assembling former trustees who have played such a large part in the College Board’s past and are interested in continuing their leadership and involvement going into the future.” As for his hopes for the Oak Circle’s future, Leo plans to build on Gordon’s exceptional leadership with a singular goal:  “To provide an open line of communication between executive leadership and those who have been part of the Board’s historic governance. It is my intent that participation in the Oak Circle will be meaningful to both the Board and the volunteer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oak Circle is grateful for Gordon’s fantastic leadership as we look forward to the future growth that Munson will guide the Oak Circle in. Congratulations to a great start, Oak Circle, and to the two exceptional leaders who will continue to shape the group’s success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Celebrating the College Board’s Oak Circle&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What drew you to the College Board?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;I’m drawn to the College Board for a number of reasons. Initially I was drawn to the organization because I have tremendous respect for its influence, reach, and reputation for producing high-quality work. There are many organizations that promote opportunity, access, and success for students as they consider and pursue postsecondary education, but I can’t think of another organization that has the ability to engage so many actors in this effort — students, parents, teachers, counselors, secondary school administrators, college and university administrators and faculty, policymakers — all of whom are critically important when it comes to ensuring that all students acquire the knowledge and skills to succeed in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;I was also drawn to the mission of challenging all students to own their future, because it’s powerful and it rings true. I first encountered the College Board when I was a young person taking the PSAT/NMSQT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, and I remember how meaningful that experience was for me. I grew up with parents who expected me to go to college, but it wasn’t until I took the test that I truly began to own that decision. It wasn’t until that moment that I saw myself as a person preparing for college, and I became acutely aware that what I did from that point on to prepare myself for college mattered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What excites you most about your new role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;I’m excited that it brings together three very important functions — membership, governance, higher education — that are related but have the potential to be more integrated. There’s creative opportunity in that challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;I’m also looking forward to working closely with so many of our external partners — member organizations, Trustees, council members, postsecondary institutions — in our effort to achieve greater educational equity. To be able to tap into their wisdom and experience, and then help us maximize the potential of these partnerships toward a common goal, is tremendously exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the most critical issue in education that needs to be addressed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;There are so many important issues that need to be addressed, but I think one of the most critical is ensuring that we instill in young people a hunger for learning at an early age and continue to stoke that fire with challenging, engaging content taught effectively, all the while holding ourselves and our students to high standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;One discouraging experience can extinguish a student’s academic confidence in an instant. We need to be mindful of that. But conversely, in an instant, a positive experience, reinforced and nurtured over time, can lead that student to realize that he is capable of more than he imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;Many years ago, when I was a graduate student writing my dissertation, I decided that I needed to do something to break up the monotony of sitting behind a computer all day, every day. I needed to do something that had a practical application that would remind me why I decided to embark on this journey to an English literature Ph.D. in the first place. So I signed up to teach middle school language arts in an after-school program in East Palo Alto, California, just down the road from Stanford University, where I was a student, but in many ways half a world away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;Unlike Palo Alto, East Palo Alto was quite economically depressed, and the students I taught — all students of color — came from families with limited financial resources. One day I decided to teach a chapter from Zora Neale Hurston’s autobiography &lt;em&gt;Dust Tracks on a Road,&lt;/em&gt; the chapter in which Hurston talks about her experience going to college as a young African American woman in the early 1900s. At one point I said to the class, matter-of-factly, “So, when you go to college….” I remember so many of the students looking at me as if I had said “Mars” instead of “college.” Many of them laughed. One student asked me, “What’s college?” And when she asked me that question, I knew in that moment how different the trajectory of her life was going to be from mine unless she not only understood what college was but knew that she could aspire to it. Perhaps that experience more than any other inspired me to make my life’s work education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can the College Board and its membership best address this issue?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;By reaching out and finding that student I just mentioned, making her aware that college is within her reach, giving her the tools to prepare for college, encouraging her to strive for higher learning and ensuring that challenging content is there to meet her, and then making colleges aware that she is prepared to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a former English lit professor, what was your favorite book to teach and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;One of my favorite books to teach was W. E. B. Du Bois’s &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Souls of Black Folk.&lt;/em&gt; I found it interesting to teach because it’s a text that is simultaneously and profoundly literary, lyrical, historical, and political. As a result, there are so many different points of engagement for the reader. I loved seeing students grapple with the challenging subjects such as race, class, and culture through these various lenses — and seeing which they chose as their point of entry into the text. I always found the student papers written about &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Souls of Black Folk&lt;/em&gt; among the most interesting, original, and enjoyable to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under your leadership, Ed Trust was recognized as a Great Place to Work by &lt;em&gt;Washingtonian&lt;/em&gt; magazine. What’s your secret?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;Oh gosh, no secret really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;But one of the first things I did when I got to the Ed Trust is go on a listening tour. I spoke with every single person in the organization and asked two questions: What do you think works well in the organization and what would you like to see us do better? I then analyzed the data and proposed to my colleagues a strategy for maintaining our strengths and prioritizing our areas in need of improvement. With organizational buy-in on the strategy, we then built the operational infrastructure to help us reach those goals and hired some wonderfully smart, talented, hardworking people along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;In addition to ensuring that we were operationally sound, we worked hard to ensure that our work — programmatically and operationally — was appropriately integrated, from long-term strategic planning to day-to-day decision making. But I want to stress that we worked on it. It didn’t happen overnight, and we never achieved perfection. But I can say with confidence that with each passing year we got better. The Great Place to Work recognition was special because it was our staff telling us they felt we were a great place to work. So it helped us know we were moving in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We know you like to travel; tell us about your most recent trip. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;My most recent trip was a five-day cycling adventure in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in North and South Carolina. We did about 40 to 45 miles each day with pretty steep elevation gain, most of the time in 95-degree heat. It was fun, and the scenery was beautiful. I enjoy a physical challenge, but typically I choose my climate more wisely. Lesson learned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Getting to Know Ericka Miller, College Board&amp;#039;s new Chief of Membership, Governance, and Higher Education&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
