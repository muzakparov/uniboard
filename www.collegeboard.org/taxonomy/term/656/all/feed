&lt;p&gt;This is my first year attending Forum and I’m very excited to be here. I was invited to come as a member of the College Board Enrollment Leadership Academy of the middle states region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you most looking forward to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting more information about the redesigned SAT; and developing a better understanding of the new assessment so I will be equipped to answer students’ questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What information will you bring back to your school?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific information about the redesigned SAT. A lot of us in the field have a general idea of what the new SAT will entail, but I’m looking forward to sharing new details with my team, specifically communication plans and recruitment strategies we can use to support students in the transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s one thing you’ve enjoyed learning about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, as a college admission counselor, I enjoyed learning more about Khan Academy. I work with a lot of students who struggle on the SAT, and now I know I can recommend this great, free tool to help them prepare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Overheard at Forum: Carlos O.

&lt;p&gt;Joanna Garcia – Oxnard 12th&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;grader&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I had no idea what I was doing until I watched the preview video.  I really liked how they gave you examples on the problems. On the final exam, I was never really able to go into that. I thought it was my computer — it would always keep loading and loading — but I did print it out, which I thought was really cool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amairee Stokes – Columbus 10th-grader&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t know what the SAT was; I was glad I had Khan Academy because they had a whole SAT section and it tells what the SAT is about, things that are going to be on the test, and how the scoring is done. I like [how] if you get a question wrong, they have little notes, they explain why that answer is the right one. I really like how Khan Academy has all the videos and stuff if you don’t understand something. I am really grateful I got the chance to go on Khan Academy because I now know what the SAT is about. “&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our College Board team took copious notes and promised to improve the student experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You should do commercials to let people know about the free SAT practice, on YouTube and stuff like that,” said Joanna. We say, let the cameras roll!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;What Students Are Really Saying About Official SAT Practice&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

He noted that students will be able to create a personalized practice plan that adapts to their needs and provides support where they need it most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Preparation is one thing, but practice is everything. What we are doing with Khan Academy is getting kids to practice in a way that will prepare them for college courses,” Coleman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khan regaled the audience with the story of Khan Academy’s formation: he began shooting tutorial videos for his cousin and uploading them to YouTube. What he thought would be an educational experiment among family members grew into something larger as his videos racked up more and more viewers and comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know how many of you spend time on YouTube, but most of the comments are not thank you,” he joked with the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khan’s videos did receive plenty of positive reaction from YouTube users though, from a student attributing them for a recent A to a soldier thanking Khan for helping him prepare to return to school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A seed was planted, and Khan decided to leave his job and focus his attention on Khan Academy, whose mission would be to change education for the better by providing a free world-class education for anyone, anywhere. With support from passionate donors and advocates like Bill Gates, Khan Academy became a force in education. To-date Khan Academy has answered more than 2.5 billion problems for its more than 12 million unique monthly users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, Khan Academy and the College Board are partnering to make sure that all students have access to a quality education. The partnership will start by providing free, best-in-class SAT test preparation to all students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What you’re hearing on stage is only the beginning of this partnership with the College Board,” Khan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khan closed out the opening plenary by sharing Khan Academy’s “You Can Learn Anything” video and reiterating his passion for accessible education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Together we can make education, which has always been scarce and expensive, a fundamental human right,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;As SAT enters a new era this week, students say the exam has improved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/people/nick-anderson&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(46, 109, 157); font-family: FranklinITCProBold, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nick Anderson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-normal modal-0 horizontal-photo&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; border-top-width: 0px; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: FranklinITCProLight, HelveticaNeue, &#039;Helvetica Neue Light&#039;, &#039;Helvetica Neue&#039;, Helvetica, Arial, &#039;Lucida Grande&#039;, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;courtesy-of-the-resizer zoom-in&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_908w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/03/01/Others/Images/2016-02-29/COLLEGEBOARD_Paskova_0041456793468.jpg&amp;amp;w=1484&quot; style=&quot;cursor:-webkit-zoom-in; width:619px&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;College Board President David Coleman at his office in Manhattan.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK — The SAT’s infamous guessing penalty is gone. Its vocabulary is less arcane, minus words like “lachrymose” and “obsequious” that students tended to memorize and then forget. Its essay is now optional. The perfect score — set in 2005 at 2400 — is reverting to the iconic standard from generations past: 1600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most important change to the retooled college admission test that debuts this week for hundreds of thousands of students nationwide lies in its approach to what they learn in high school. The new version of the SAT aims more than ever to measure core skills taught in school, such as reading charts, analyzing evidence and applying algebra in mathematical problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board, which owns the 90-year-old test, sought to purge the tricky questions — akin to brain teasers — that were vestiges of what used to be called a “scholastic aptitude” measurement. The theory behind aptitude testing was to find innate potential in students regardless of where they went to school. Now the SAT is officially described as an achievement test meant to reward those who study hard in class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It most resembles the work that kids are already doing in the classroom,” College Board President David Coleman said this week in in an interview with The Washington Post at his office here in New York. “I think the old SAT was a departure from kids’ everyday work, in their schoolwork. Evidently. It was almost universally felt to be so.”&lt;/p&gt;

(Family photo)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo Barrillon and Jordana Graveley, juniors at Conard High School in West Hartford, Conn., called the revision an improvement. They took the SAT on Wednesday during school along with 40,000 other 11th-graders in Connecticut, with testing fees fully paid by the state. Both also had taken the old version in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I noticed that in the reading, there were a lot more ‘evidence-based’ questions,” said Barrillon, 16. “You would have to find a source from the text to support your answer to the previous question. That was definitely different.” Barrillon said he believed the new test reflected his studies more than the old one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo-right modal-2&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; margin: 0.5em 0px 10px 20px; padding: 0px; float: right; clear: right; max-width: 100%; border: 0px none; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: FranklinITCProLight, HelveticaNeue, &#039;Helvetica Neue Light&#039;, &#039;Helvetica Neue&#039;, Helvetica, Arial, &#039;Lucida Grande&#039;, sans-serif; width: 150px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;66401f335d&quot; id=&quot;66401f335d&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Jordana Graveley (family photo)&quot; class=&quot;zoom-in&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2016/03/graveley-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;cursor:-webkit-zoom-in; max-width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jordana Graveley. (Family photo)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a lot more focused on what we have learned in school,” Gravely, also 16, agreed. One of the reading passages, she said, was a document that covered material familiar from history lessons. “The vocab was really actually something that you would encounter in real life,” she said. The old SAT penalized students for incorrect answers, to deter guessing. But the new SAT eliminates that rule. “It’s a lot less of learning how to take the test than the old one was,” Graveley said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new SAT also was rolled out Wednesday in schools in the District of Columbia, New Hampshire, selected New York City schools, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Jose, and in Florida’s Hillsborough and Seminole counties. On Saturday morning, 277,000 students from across the country are scheduled to sit for the test. In all, 463,000 students are expected to take the new SAT this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruce Reed, a test-preparation consultant in California, said student perceptions about the new SAT matter less, in the end, than whether the test yields reliable and valid results to help admissions officers do their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Isn’t it ultimately about the colleges?” he said. “It’s a hollow victory if it’s just a test that feels better when you’re taking it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revision has been years in the making. Coleman, one of the architects of the Common Core State Standards, was given a mandate to rethink the admission test when he took the helm of the College Board in 2012. The Common Core spells out what students should learn in math and English language arts from kindergarten through high school. Those standards, and the assessments connected to them, were widely adopted but have proven politically controversial. The College Board considered Coleman’s expertise an asset as the nonprofit organization grappled with discontent about its marquee test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-normal horizontal-photo modal-3&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: FranklinITCProLight, HelveticaNeue, &#039;Helvetica Neue Light&#039;, &#039;Helvetica Neue&#039;, Helvetica, Arial, &#039;Lucida Grande&#039;, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;ce49200722&quot; id=&quot;ce49200722&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;courtesy-of-the-resizer zoom-in&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_908w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/03/01/Others/Images/2016-02-29/COLLEGEBOARD_Paskova_0091456793470.jpg&amp;amp;w=1484&quot; style=&quot;cursor:-webkit-zoom-in; width:619px&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;A screen in the lobby of the office of College Board president David Coleman, in Manhattan, on Feb. 29.

&lt;p&gt;The last overhaul of the SAT, in 2005, added a writing section with a required 25-minute essay, worth a maximum of 800 points, to the math and critical reading sections, also worth up to 800 points each. In ensuing years, the SAT lost market share to the rival ACT admission test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACT, based in Iowa, assesses English, reading, math and science, with an optional essay. It has long been perceived as a straightforward achievement test, with slightly higher time pressure per question than the SAT. It does not have a guessing penalty, and it has never purported to measure aptitude. Colleges now accept either test equally, and in 2012, the ACT surpassed the SAT in usage. In the nation’s Class of 2015, about 1.9 million students took the ACT, compared to 1.7 million who took the SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/12/24/the-sat-now-the-no-2-college-test-pushes-to-reclaim-supremacy/&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(46, 109, 157); border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(212, 212, 212); zoom: 1;&quot;&gt;The SAT, now the No. 2 college test, pushes to reclaim supremacy&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One cannot ignore we’re in competition with the ACT,” Coleman acknowledged. But he said that was not the main driver of the SAT changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman unveiled his vision for the new SAT in March 2014. He wanted a transparent test, stripped of trickery and grounded firmly in what students learn. He also announced that the College Board would team with the nonprofit Khan Academy to offer students free online tutorials for the SAT, a measure aiming to reduce the advantage of families wealthy enough to hire private test-preparation consultants. Since June, 900,000 students have registered with Khan for SAT practice and have completed 39 million problems, Coleman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old SAT took 3 hours and 45 minutes. The new version is 3 hours, plus another 50 minutes for those who opt to write an essay. The two core sections are math and “evidence-based reading and writing.” Most of the questions are multiple-choice, but some math questions require students to write in an answer. The math section focuses on algebra, data analysis and fluency with complex equations and expressions in preparation for advanced math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculators, previously allowed throughout the math section, are now barred from certain portions of the new test. There also is less emphasis on geometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/college-board-releases-preview-of-new-sat-exam-questions/2014/04/15/d59f2f9c-c4a1-11e3-bcec-b71ee10e9bc3_story.html&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(46, 109, 157); border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(212, 212, 212); zoom: 1;&quot;&gt;College Board releases preview of new SAT exam questions&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some prominent universities in recent years — including Wake Forest and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/07/27/george-washington-university-applicants-no-longer-need-to-take-admissions-tests/&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(46, 109, 157); border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(212, 212, 212); zoom: 1;&quot;&gt;George Washington — have dropped requirements&lt;/a&gt;for applicants to submit SAT or ACT scores. Critics of the tests say that they are a needless barrier to college access for disadvantaged students, and that transcripts and other information can tell colleges all they need to know about an applicant’s academic potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the large majority of selective colleges, in the Ivy League and beyond, continue to require submission of scores. They will be watching closely how the revised SAT performs its mission of helping to predict college success. That could take years to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re quite optimistic that it will be at least as good as the old test,” said William R. Fitzsimmons, longtime dean of admissions and financial aid at Harvard University. “But we have to wait and see.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitzsimmons predicted that many students will cheer getting rid of flash-card vocabulary — “words that appear only once in your lifetime, but really have no connection to what you encounter in college or after college.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah Quinlan, dean of undergraduate admissions at Yale, said getting ready for college should never be about tricks or last-minute cramming for a test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I believe that the redesigned SAT is on the right path in its transparency and openness, and that it sends the clear signal that if you work hard and achieve, we in higher education will work to open doors for you,” Quinlan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbara Jenkins, superintendent of schools in Orange County, Fla., which serves tens of thousands of students from low-income families, said she is “most excited” about changes to the SAT that suggest its payoffs are not reserved only for the elite or for those who can afford a prep course. The message, she said, is that practice pays off for anybody. “There’s not some anointing that you’re ‘smart’ or ‘not smart,&#039;” Jenkins said. “Instead, it’s something you work toward to open opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education is replete with inequities, from preschool through college, with students from affluent backgrounds enjoying far more educational resources; there are strong correlations between standardized test scores and family income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman said he is mindful that those inequities are stubborn. But he said the SAT’s revision, coupled with the Khan Academy initiative, gives the College Board a strong reply to critics who say that privilege can purchase an edge in opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You say ‘SAT’ and people say, ‘Well what about the test prep?&#039;” Coleman said. He said that many people wonder “how can a challenge be fair if the tools of practice are costly, and if there’s a sense of mystery and that some people can sell you the secrets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step to reform was clear, he said: “I had to get rid of the secrets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Panel on Student Opportunity is made up of diverse high school and college student representatives from across the U.S. Members must make a three-year commitment to the panel, and be willing to speak and travel independently, attend annual conferences, and provide the College Board with a student voice. Each year, about 80 applications are received for three new spots on the panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re here to remind you that you’re doing this for the students,” panel member Liliana Esquivel said as Tuesday’s session opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students reiterated their passion for the work of the College Board and Forum attendees, noting the passionate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/counseling-admissions-financial-aid-academic/sal-khan-opens-college-board&quot;&gt;opening plenary from Sal Khan&lt;/a&gt; as a highlight of the conference so far. The hour long conversation with audience members brought to light several themes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive outlook on the redesigned SAT: &lt;/strong&gt;Students expressed optimism about the redesigned SAT, debuting in spring 2016. “The exam will serve as a means of demonstrating prowess and academic accomplishment, rather than as a test that you need to cram for and find all the tricky manipulative ways to do well on,” said panel member Will Larsen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to resources and Information throughout the College Application Process: &lt;/strong&gt;members highlighted programs in their schools that provide support and resources to students as they navigate the college application process. Examples included hosting a panel of alumni in their first year of college, and “Application Fridays” where students bring in their applications to work with counselors and teachers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenging coursework is for everyone: &lt;/strong&gt;students argued that programs that put students in categories early on in high school make it harder for students to elevate themselves out of that track. “It’s really important for kids to get the sense that they can succeed in Advanced Placement (AP) no matter what their previous classes were,” said panel member Jack Seigenthaler. “It needs to be a message of opportunity rather than a message of selectivity.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early engagement can support diversity in advanced coursework: &lt;/strong&gt;panel members suggested connecting with middle school students and their families and translating materials into several languages as ways to encourage diverse students to take AP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the students reiterated their passion for the work of the Advisory Panel on Student Opportunity and its role within the College Board as the organization works toward its mission of delivering opportunity to all students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Advisory Panel on Student Opportunity Shares Views on Access to Education, Rigorous Coursework&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Read the original release on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/must-read-student-reactions-following-first-administration-of-the-new-sat-300231441.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PR Newswire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March 5, 2016  -- Today hundreds of thousands of students across the country took the first national administration of the redesigned SAT®. Changes to the test include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A focus on the areas of math that matter most&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An emphasis on more relevant vocabulary words&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No penalty for guessing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An optional essay&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The College Board conducted a survey of 8,089 students who completed the March SAT administration earlier today. We compared this year&#039;s results for some of the same questions to the responses of 6,494 examinees during the identical timeframe after the March 2015 SAT administration. Below you&#039;ll find student reactions to test content, information on how they prepared for the test, and some fun facts about their test day experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Test Content&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of students had positive reactions to taking the new SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;71% of students said the test reflected what they&#039;re learning in school.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;By a 6 to 1 margin, students said they preferred the format of the new SAT over the previous version of the test.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;75% of students said the Reading Test was the same as or easier than they expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;80% of students said the vocabulary on the test would be useful to them later in life, compared with 55% in March 2015.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;59% of students said the Math section tests the skills and knowledge needed for success in college and career.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Preparation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the test&#039;s redesign, the College Board partnered with Khan Academy® to offer free, personalized test practice to all students. Since the resources launched in June 2015, more than 900,000 students have taken advantage of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compared with March 2015 SAT administration, there was a 19% decrease in the number of students that paid for test prep resources.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nearly half of all examinees who took the SAT today prepared with Khan Academy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;98% of examinees who prepared with Khan Academy found it extremely, very, or somewhat helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fun Facts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to know what students ate before taking the test? Here&#039;s what they had to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;3 hot cakes with maple syrup, one sausage patty, and a hash brown.&quot; –Nhan, 16, NC&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Sunny side up eggs with cayenne pepper on oat nut bread toast.&quot; –Alex, 17, PA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;An English muffin with butter and peanut butter and a banana with coffee.&quot; –Stephanie, 18, PA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avocado on corn tortilla, and a pumpkin protein bar.&quot; –Kelly, 17, IL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s how students said they&#039;re celebrating after completing the SAT:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I performed a rendition of &lt;span&gt;Aretha Franklin&#039;s&lt;/span&gt; hit single &#039;Think (Freedom).&#039;&quot; –Matthew, 17, PA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I&#039;m going to treat myself with ice cream.&quot;–Ramis, 16, FL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Order Chinese food and go rock climbing.&quot; –Lawrence, 16, VA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many SAT-takers listened to music to focus before the test. Here are their favorite songs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.    &quot;Work&quot; by Rihanna &lt;br /&gt;1.    &quot;Love Yourself&quot; by &lt;span&gt;Justin Bieber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.    &quot;7 Years&quot; by &lt;span&gt;Lukas Graham&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3.    &quot;Stressed Out&quot; by Twenty One Pilots &lt;br /&gt;4.    &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; by Zayn &lt;br /&gt;5.    &quot;Sorry&quot; by &lt;span&gt;Justin Bieber&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;6.    &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; by Eminem &lt;br /&gt;7.    &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot; by Survivor &lt;br /&gt;8.    &quot;River Flows In You&quot; by Yiruma&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;In Their Own Words&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I felt I was academically ready and knew the format and general difficulty of the test.&quot; –Samuel 17, NJ&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I would describe it as taking any test that you would take at school. It&#039;s also like taking the PSAT (&lt;span&gt;NMSQT&lt;/span&gt;).&quot; –Jocelyn 17, IN&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Khan Academy was literally a godsend. I have never really been a math-centric person, and so pre-calculus is a little rough. I had already been using Khan Academy and when I hooked up my PSAT (&lt;span&gt;NMSQT&lt;/span&gt;) scores it showed me all of the math I had to review.&quot; –Nicole, 17, NH&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I felt like I had a good amount of time to completely read through the passages and select my answers as well as review some of the ones that were difficult for me.&quot; –Elizabeth, 17, WA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional information about the SAT can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sat.org/new&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Colloquium Recap: Assessment Team Presents an Update on Redesigning the SAT to a Packed House</title>

The panelists kicked off the Forum Colloquium with a review of the SAT College and Career Readiness Benchmark results: 42.6% of SAT takers in the class of 2014 met it. This percentage represents those students who are likely to be ready to take college-entry, credit-bearing courses and not need remediation and has remained virtually unchanged over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The redesign effort hopes to change these results by connecting the SAT suite of assessments more closely to what is happening in the classroom. “We will be connecting assessment to instruction. So teachers will see the questions and say ‘You bet. That’s what I’m teaching in my classroom.’” explained Cyndie Schmeiser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team then unveiled the suite of assessments and discussed the flexibility schools will have to implement them with fall and spring administrations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PSAT 8/9 (rollout fall 2015)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PSAT 10 (rollout spring 2016)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PSAT/NMSQT (rollout fall 2015)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SAT (rollout spring 2016)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these assessments will focus exclusively on what matters most for college and career readiness as appropriate at each grade level. This represents what is already happening in challenging classrooms. &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org&quot;&gt;The key changes&lt;/a&gt; and examples of old and new exam questions were shared as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Buckley, SVP of Research, took the stage to dive into the multiple ways his team is ensuring that the redesigned SAT is just as predictive, or more so, of college success than the current version. Specifically he described the importance of creating concordance tables to link one test to the other to compare scores, and the challenges associated with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme of connecting assessment to instruction came up again when discussing content validity studies and the national curriculum survey that was conducted to examine to what extent the key knowledge and skills needed for first year college success are being taught in high schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting elements Jack covered was the proposed vertical scale for the system to align the scores. For example, while the score range for the PSAT 8/9 may be 120-720 and the range for the SAT is 200-800, the results for both can be compared directly. “We will do a lot of work on the backend to make sure results are simple to use, simple to understand.” explained Jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session wrapped up with an exciting high-level overview of how students’ results from the PSAT/NMSQT can be used in conjunction with Khan Academy modules and practice exams to build Personalized Learning Roadmaps to support students throughout the preparation process.       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Colloquium Recap: Assessment Team Presents an Update on Redesigning the SAT to a Packed House&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the first administration of the new SAT, media outlets had some fun reporting on changes to the 90-year-old exam: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com&quot;&gt; The New York Times &lt;/a&gt; said farewell to obscure vocabulary words with an elegiac crossword puzzle; &lt;a href=&quot;http://time.com/money/4226478/new-sat-vocabulary-changes/&quot;&gt; TIME &lt;/a&gt; released a video of their writers attempting to define “SAT words;” &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/zorn/ct-sat-khan-kaplan-prep-act-perspec-zorn-0221-jm-20160219-column.html&quot;&gt; The Chicago Tribune &lt;/a&gt; bid adieu to the old content and welcomed Khan Academy’s world-class practice resources; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.today.com/video/today-anchors-try-out-the-new-sat-test-637647939772&quot;&gt; Today Show &lt;/a&gt; anchors answered new SAT questions live on the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College Board president David Coleman also talked to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.today.com/video/big-changes-on-the-way-for-the-sats-607455299991&quot;&gt; Today Show &lt;/a&gt; about how free, high-quality SAT practice tools can level the playing field for all students. Stacy Caldwell, vice president of college readiness assessments for the College Board, shared last-minute test-taking tips with students on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/#7ecbfd8c63cd&quot;&gt; Forbes &lt;/a&gt; . Cyndie Schmeiser, chief of assessment, talked with WBUR’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2016/03/03/new-sat-debuts&quot;&gt; Here and Now &lt;/a&gt; about how the new test focuses on the few things that evidence show matter most for college and career readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in Connecticut, teachers created an Adele parody video, titled “ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.centralctcommunications.com/bristolpress/article_21918f50-dcf9-11e5-bce6-f3e7d171bd45.html&quot;&gt; Hello SAT &lt;/a&gt; ,” to cheer on their students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, students in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-03-04/one-florida-school-district-goes-all-in-on-new-sat&quot;&gt; Florida &lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.today.com/video/big-changes-on-the-way-for-the-sats-607455299991&quot;&gt; New York &lt;/a&gt; , and &lt;a href=&quot;http://wnep.com/2016/03/03/sat-test-revamped-for-high-schoolers/&quot;&gt; Pennsylvania &lt;/a&gt; told reporters they felt confident going into the redesigned SAT; many of them had prepared for it using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt; free practice resources &lt;/a&gt; from the College Board and Khan Academy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of thousands of students finally sat down to take the exam — for free, in their own schools — on March 2, as part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/k12-educators/sat-school-day&quot;&gt; SAT School Day &lt;/a&gt; . The next morning, &lt;em&gt; The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt; announced on the front page that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/03/03/as-sat-enters-a-new-era-this-week-students-say-the-exam-has-improved/&quot;&gt; students said the exam has improved &lt;/a&gt; . And a story from &lt;em&gt; The Associated Press &lt;/em&gt; , which was subsequently picked up by more than 250 national and local outlets, began:  “Not so tricky. More straightforward. Guessing allowed. The newly redesigned SAT college entrance exam that debuts nationally Saturday is getting good reviews from some of the students who took it early this week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands more students across the country took the SAT on Saturday, March 5, and continued to celebrate the changes. Based on results from College Board’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/releases/2016/student-reactions-first-administration-new-sat&quot;&gt; post-administration survey &lt;/a&gt; of more than  8,000 test-takers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.educationworld.com/a_news/19-percent-less-students-pay-sat-test-prep-thanks-college-board-khan-academy-partnership&quot;&gt; Education World &lt;/a&gt; announced that “71 percent of students reportedly said the test reflected what they are learning in school” and “19 percent fewer students are paying for test preparation thanks to the free resources now available to them’’ — namely, Khan Academy.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-03-07-what-do-rihanna-and-oat-nut-bread-toast-have-to-do-with-the-new-sat&quot;&gt; EdSurge &lt;/a&gt; shared how students got ready for the test, revealing what they ate for breakfast and what songs they listened to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few students took to Twitter with their successes:    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/OfficialSAT&quot;&gt;@OfficialSAT &lt;/a&gt; I really liked the new SAT!&lt;/p&gt;— E (@edgarjimenezlun) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/edgarjimenezlun/status/706175245812637696&quot;&gt; March 5, 2016 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the heels on these positive reactions, David Coleman and Sal Khan had one more big announcement to make this week: more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2016/03/09/students-sat-free-prep/81567104/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; 1 million users &lt;/a&gt; have practiced for the SAT through Khan Academy, and the number is growing. &lt;/p&gt;

The purpose of this daylong event was to share information about the redesigned PSAT/NMSQT&lt;sup&gt;® &lt;/sup&gt;and SAT and begin discussions about how college access organizations can best use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;Khan Academy’s&lt;/a&gt; tools and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the top five things we learned during the summit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because the first administrations of the redesigned PSAT/NMSQT (October 2015) and SAT (spring 2016) are fast approaching, the college access community is eager to get the inside track on what to expect and to learn how to prepare their students for success; representatives from as far away as California, Minnesota, and Georgia traveled to New York for the Summit.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participants, including representatives from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bgca.org/&quot;&gt;Boys &amp;amp; Girls Clubs of America&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kipp.org/&quot;&gt;KIPP Public Charter Schools&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.collegehorizons.org/&quot;&gt;College Horizons&lt;/a&gt; (which provides college and graduate admission workshops to Native American students), and Pennsylvania’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.needld.org/&quot;&gt;NEED&lt;/a&gt; (a nonprofit offering college and career readiness programs for local youth), underscored the importance of ensuring that educators, parents, and students know exactly where to find the right tools, information, test practice resources, and support.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Members of the College Board’s Assessment Design &amp;amp; Development team led “Test Change 101,” a session focused on the redesign of the SAT and PSAT/NMSQT. One participant praised the team for “unfailingly [giving] real answers” during its Q&amp;amp;A session. Although there was an overall sentiment of excitement, questions remain about plans to support educators in curriculum preparations and to support parents in learning about Khan Academy’s free practice resources.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The College Board’s partnership with Khan Academy is of particular interest to the college access community; participants offered feedback on potential Khan Academy implementation models as well as possible challenges students may face, such as lack of Internet connectivity and mentor/volunteer training.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A closing session on the College Board’s Access to Opportunity&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; initiative inspired a dialogue among participants about sharing best practices to make sure schools, teachers, parents, and students are able to take full advantage of Khan Academy’s dynamic resources and tools.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leading up to the administration of the redesigned PSAT/NMSQT and SAT, the College Board will continue to develop resources and professional development opportunities designed to support college access organizations, with an emphasis on how to most effectively integrate Khan Academy’s tools into everyday work with students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about the College Board’s collaborations with college access organizations, please email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:tkraft@collegeboard.org&quot;&gt;Tierney Kraft&lt;/a&gt;, the College Board’s director of SAT Partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>More Than One Million Students Have Taken Advantage of Free, Personalized SAT Practice </title>

That’s four times the number of students who pay for commercial prep test each year, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2016/03/09/students-sat-free-prep/81567104/&quot;&gt; USA Today &lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the College Board’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/releases/2016/student-reactions-first-administration-new-sat&quot;&gt; post-administration survey &lt;/a&gt;  of students, almost half of all SAT test-takers on March 5 used the Official SAT Practice to prepare, compared to the 10% who used commercial test prep. That means 19% fewer students have paid for SAT prep resources this year alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data show that the free resources are reaching students across all races, ethnicities, and income-levels, creating a more level playing field. “More students, whatever their level of income, are preparing for the SAT with Khan Academy than with all commercial test prep combined — at every level of income,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2016/03/09/students-sat-free-prep/81567104/&quot;&gt; Coleman said at the annual SXSWedu conference &lt;/a&gt;  on Wednesday. “Never in my career have I seen a launch of technology at this scale that has broken down the racial divisions that so haunt this nation — never.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Khan Academy team worked closely with the College Board assessment design team to create practice resources that are aligned with the new test. When students link their College Board and Khan Academy accounts, they receive a personalized plan based on their PSAT/NMSQT scores. Students are encouraged to follow their practice plan to get ready for test day, and so far — from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.today.com/video/big-changes-on-the-way-for-the-sats-607455299991&quot;&gt; New York City &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9qM1eezN-c&quot;&gt; Orlando, Florida &lt;/a&gt; — they are embracing that challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the data, students themselves have spoken about the positive impact of the free practice tools. “Khan Academy was literally a godsend,” said a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/releases/2016/student-reactions-first-administration-new-sat&quot;&gt; student from New Hampshire &lt;/a&gt; . Said a student from Oak Ridge High School: “Honestly, I&#039;d say it is a game. You practice but you don&#039;t notice you&#039;re kinda competing with yourself. It&#039;s fun. I like it a lot.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, we were reminded why free practice on Khan Academy is so critical to our efforts to deliver opportunity to students. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.today.com/video/some-sat-prep-courses-accused-of-charging-students-unfairly-642123331566&quot;&gt; Today Show &lt;/a&gt; aired a segment, based on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/asians-nearly-twice-as-likely-to-get-higher-price-from-princeton-review&quot;&gt;  ProPublica report &lt;/a&gt; , documenting how paid commercial test prep companies are charging students different amounts for their test prep resources. Specifically, Propublica reported that the Princeton Review charges Asian students almost two times as much as non-Asian students, regardless of income or geographic location. The contrast between the free, world-class practice with Khan Academy and the price gauging by commercial test prep companies is stark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board and Khan Academy teamed up to create Official SAT Practice to level the playing field and address the inequities that resulted from the high-priced test prep industry. “Why not aspire to create something so good that even the most affluent who has the payment options will want to use it?” said Khan at SXSWedu. With thousands of interactive problems, video lessons, and more from the creators of the test and Khan Academy, Official SAT Practice is the best way for students to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;More Than One Million Students Have Taken Advantage of Free, Personalized SAT Practice &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

This group of K12 and higher education educators meets regularly with College Board staff to discuss topics related to the SAT. This year with the implementation of the College Board&#039;s assessment redesign, the SAT Committee will be particularly busy. All Access caught up with Donald to discuss his term as chair, and what to expect from the Committee over the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Access: When, and why, did you first become involved with the College Board’s committees and governance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Donald Kamentz: I first joined the SAT Committee in November 2011. Having been involved in the college admission field (on both the higher ed and K–12 sides) for many years and, in particular, working with predominantly low-income, first-generation college-bound students at YES Prep Public Schools, I felt that my diverse experience could be an asset to the committee and our collective work — to ensure that our focus is on ALL students and assisting them with building their college knowledge while creating opportunities and possibilities rather than limiting them. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: Who makes up the SAT Committee, and how often does the committee meet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DK: The SAT Committee is comprised of educational professionals from both the K–12 and higher education sectors. Formally, the committee meets three times a year (in November, January, and May), with conference calls and other interactions throughout the year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: How does your involvement with the SAT Committee and the College Board influence your day-to-day work at YES Prep?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DK: I believe my day-to-day work at YES Prep directly and heavily influences my work on the SAT Committee and with the College Board, and as one would suspect, it occurs vice versa as well. The robust College Board programs and assessments that are used by YES Prep and our students, including PSAT/NMSQT, SAT, AP, and CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, all directly inform and guide our instruction in our classrooms. Equally, it’s this work in our schools that directs my focus and energies on the SAT Committee, working to ensure these programs provide much-needed support for my colleagues and students, not becoming hindrances or obstacles to postsecondary opportunities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: What are some of the overall goals of the SAT Committee for the coming two-year term?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DK: Some of our overall goals for the work of our committee over the next two years include:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advocacy for continued transparency with the redesign and all aspects of the PSAT/NMSQT and SAT programs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ongoing use of the committee members’ expertise to help guide the operational implementation, communications, and support of the redesign&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greater collaboration across the different programs and divisions within the College Board directly involved in the redesign, but on the micro and macro levels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: The redesign of the SAT and the College Board Readiness and Success System will clearly be a major focus of the committee over the next two years. How will the committee prioritize the different elements of the redesign at the right times to best serve the higher ed and K–12 communities throughout the rollout?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DK: Working very closely with all teams involved with these areas at the College Board, the SAT Committee will continue to provide the expertise and counsel that it has since the redesign was announced last year and thus will provide the continuity of knowledge and support that we believe will be especially pivotal over the next two years and beyond. At our meetings, and via email updates and conference calls, there is always a concurrent focus on several concerns — on the redesigned assessments themselves, on how the latest information and components are being shared out to our members, and on the support needed for smooth implementation. Having day-to-day practitioners from diverse K–12 and higher ed institutions on the committee allows us to ensure all perspectives and considerations are addressed by the College Board teams most directly working on these areas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: Talk a little bit about the shift that members will see to the PSAT&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; 8/9 and PSAT/NMSQT. What’s different about the PSAT/NMSQT? What will remain the same?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DK: The redesigned PSAT/NMSQT will be aligned with the redesigned SAT and will launch in October 2015. Like the SAT, the redesigned PSAT/NMSQT will measure the skills and knowledge that are essential for college readiness and success. Here are some of the key changes students will encounter on the redesigned exams:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Relevant Words in Context&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Command of Evidence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Essay analyzing a source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Focus on Math That Matters Most&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Problems Grounded in Real-World Contexts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analysis in Science and in History/Social Studies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founding Documents and Great Global Conversation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Penalty for Wrong Answers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some opportunities for members to engage with the committee, or the College Board in general, throughout the implementation process? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DK: First off, I would encourage all members to learn more about the specific changes on the SAT redesign, along with available supporting materials at the College Board’s dedicated &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/about&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;website&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for the redesign.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knowing that both the SAT Committee and Higher Education Working Group are made up of representatives from both K–12 and higher ed, I encourage everyone to seek out those members you might know to provide any thoughts, suggestions, and recommendations to best assist you and, most importantly, our students and families. Utilize the opportunities to engage College Board staff at many of the events sponsored by the College Board such as regional and national forums, as well as those sponsored by other organizations where College Board staff is in attendance.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remember, the College Board is a membership-driven organization and its goal is to support members in their collective service to students and their families.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;SAT Committee Chair Donald Kamentz Gears up for 2015 and the Redesigned SAT&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Students will receive their scores on May 10. Educators will receive the full online score reports on June 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators can learn more about &lt;strong&gt;accessing scores&lt;/strong&gt; online and during our upcoming webinar, &lt;strong&gt;How to Access Scores for the SAT Suite of Assessments&lt;/strong&gt;, on May 19, at 1 p.m. ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher education institutions will continue to use SAT scores as they have in the past — as one factor in their admission decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help educators guide students in &lt;strong&gt;understanding&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;scores&lt;/strong&gt; from the new SAT, the College Board has created some new resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq07MvKOc1o&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A short video&lt;/a&gt; that explains what students will find on their score reports.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detailed information about &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/about/scores/benchmarks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;benchmarks&lt;/a&gt; (including a &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/pdf/educator-benchmark-brief.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;guide for educators&lt;/a&gt;), percentiles, and subscores.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concordance tables and tools are also now available to help students, counselors, and colleges understand and use scores from the new SAT®.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/scores/understanding-scores/sat-score-converter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SAT Score Converter&lt;/a&gt; will allow students and counselors to easily compare scores from the old SAT and the new SAT. The converter is available for iPhone and Android phones, and on the web.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can also now access the complete concordance tables for the new SAT at &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/educators/higher-ed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sat.org/highered&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tables will be available to concord scores in both directions — from the new SAT to the old SAT and vice-versa — in Excel and PDF formats. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming soon: A spreadsheet-based tool will be provided for colleges where there is no automated solution for concording a large number of scores quickly.               &lt;/p&gt;

Since the announcement, state officials, education leaders, and news outlets have voiced support for the change that will allow Michigan students, parents, and educators to take advantage of the opportunities College Board redesigned assessments have to offer. We&#039;re pleased to share a great editorial from the Detroit News. The full text and a link to the original article can be found below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State scores in switch to SAT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michigan students will take new college entrance exam in 2016, saving state money&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally posted on January 9 on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/01/09/michigan-chooses-sat-act/21458857/&quot;&gt;The Detroit News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to keep track of all the acronyms that fly around the education sphere, but the Michigan Department of Education’s decision to move to the SAT from the ACT is a significant change. While some school officials aren’t happy about dealing with a new test, it’s a switch that will save taxpayers money — and offer students some additional benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2007, all Michigan high school juniors have been required to take the ACT college entrance exam as part of the Michigan Merit Exam, in part to encourage more students to apply to college. Michigan law requires high school students to take a college entrance exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move to the SAT, starting in 2016, should be fairly seamless for students, according to department officials and some education reform experts. Like the ACT, the SAT will be offered free of charge to all juniors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everyone is pleased with this change. Some school administrators feel blindsided and upset they now have to meet a new target after years of building a curriculum around the ACT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Department officials should take these concerns seriously, especially since so much pressure is placed on schools to meet certain benchmarks on these tests. More leniency should be afforded schools as they transition to this new standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the financial savings are real, and it would have been careless of state officials to ignore that. The MDE said the College Board, which administers the SAT, won the three-year contract worth $17.1 million — a bid that was $15 million less than the ACT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Superintendent Mike Flanagan thinks this is a positive change, and points to how the SAT test “is respected and used around the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Their bid was rated the highest; provides valuable assistance to Michigan educators, students, and parents; is more aligned to Michigan’s content standards; and saves the state millions of dollars over the course of the three-year contract,” Flanagan said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MDE says to prepare for the new test, students can take practice tests, and teachers and other school officials will participate in professional development. This training is covered under the SAT contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students will benefit from these additional training opportunities. The College Board has partnered with Kahn Academy, the free, online learning resource, to provide free SAT preparation materials to all students starting in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Ackley, spokesman for the department, says nearly all colleges — including all universities in Michigan — accept the SAT test as well as the ACT, so students won’t be at a disadvantage for not taking the ACT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SAT tests students in reading, writing and math; the ACT has five parts: English, mathematics, reading, science and an optional writing test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education experts who have looked at the revamped SAT test — the one students will start taking in 2016 — say it will be more aligned to Michigan standards. Those include: requiring to back up claims, testing vocabulary in reading passages, fewer math topics but in more depth, and testing knowledge of U.S. founding documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition to the SAT will inevitably pose challenges at first, but the savings for the state and the added benefits for students made this the right call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Positive Response to Michigan SAT Announcement &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
