According to the American Indian College Fund, only 13.6% earn a college degree. Here are five ways higher education professionals can create a support system for Native American students as they progress to and through a university experience:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get to know not only high school students, but also their tribes, communities, families, and extended families&lt;/strong&gt;. Build strong relationships by participating in community events outside of school.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Represent Native American culture on campus to make it more welcoming and comfortable&lt;/strong&gt;. For instance, several schools in the Pacific Northwest now have a longhouse (a community center traditional to many tribes) on campus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offer fee waivers&lt;/strong&gt;. More than 28% of American Indians live below the poverty line. Even a small fee could become a barrier between these students and a college education.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discuss financial aid with both students &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; their parents&lt;/strong&gt;. Based on discussion during the session, parents’ number one concern about sending their child to college is almost always the cost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show Native American students how a degree can help them give back to their tribe&lt;/strong&gt;. Many feel a strong sense of commitment to their community and want to know that they can return home better-equipped to support it after college.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The session began and ended with attendees forming a circle; panelists led us in song and prayer. This visual was a powerful reminder that, just as each attendee was important to the circle’s shape, professionals in all areas of higher education can play a role in creating a strong college-going culture in Native communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;5 Ways to Encourage Native American Students to Pursue a College Degree&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;D’Andre Weaver, a quarterback on the Oak Ridge High School football team, says the work he does before a big game or a big test gives him the confidence he needs to succeed. Before taking the SAT, for example, he used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy&lt;/a&gt; to build up his math skills. “It’s like a game,” he says. “You practice, but you don’t realize you’re competing with yourself. My math skills were below par, and using Khan Academy I built it up and improved my scores dramatically.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D’Andre’s SAT score was 260 points higher than his PSAT/NMSQT score after using Official SAT Practice; he boosted his score an additional 100 points after taking the SAT a second time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wants to let other students know that—even if you’re a busy high school senior and competitive athlete—it’s possible and worth it to find time to practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explains: “The main thing you have to do is schedule a routine that you follow day in and day out. For me, there&#039;s bits and breaks where I can practice on Khan Academy, either on my phone or on the Lenovo [laptops] that are provided to us by the district. And I&#039;ve used it pretty much every day. No matter whether I&#039;m walking to the football field, going to practice, or if I’m traveling to a road game on the bus, I’m like, ‘Oh, let me pull out my phone and do some Khan Academy.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fall D’Andre will attend Lawrence University on both an athletic and academic scholarship. Watch him tell his story below, and visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://cb.collegeboard.org/sat/better-takes-practice/&quot;&gt;satpractice.org/go&lt;/a&gt; to see how other Oak Ridge students are practicing hard to achieve their own goals.&lt;/p&gt;

This installment of the “Senior Year Chronicles” summarizes Andrew Elwell’s conversations with Rhea from New Jersey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first impression of Rhea was her polite and respectful manner.  It reminded me of my southern upbringing, minus the &quot;yes, ma’am.&quot; As we talked,  it became obvious that she has a close relationship with her parents, who were key in helping her prepare for college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I first asked Rhea about college, she confidently rattled off her plans. She wanted to major in Information Science and International Affairs because of her interest in cyber security and counterterrorism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a kid, I grew up always being surrounded by the news,&quot; she told me. &quot;My parents are firm believers that you should have a proper understanding of current events so you can try to make a difference in the future. Whenever I would sit and read the paper with my parents, they would explain to me that sometimes bad things happen on a daily basis. Being constantly surrounded by these events every day inspired me to want to help people in my future career. I knew public service was what I wanted to do, but I never really knew what that meant for me. In middle school, I took an online forensics course through John&#039;s Hopkins University and immediately fell in love with it. This then inspired me to want to incorporate technology in my public service career. When I grew older I became fascinated with the stories of the FBI using technology to thwart a terror attack, and I decided I wanted to go into the field of counterterrorism to do exactly that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhea&#039;s parentswere very helpful in assisting her with college applications, having navigated the process before with her older sister. Her parents were also very supportive about the major and colleges she had chosen to apply to, and they accompanied her on visits to college campuses. By October, she had settled on George Washington University (GW) as her top choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of preparing for college applications, Rhea played tenor saxophone and was also a member of the Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), where she served as Vice President of Community Service. Each year the organizatoin hosts a large event called Project Hope; people from all over the county attend, and proceeds are donated to a specific charity chosen for the year. This year Rhea was in charge of selecting the charity and appointing club members to run different activities at the event.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While her goal was to attend GW, she decided not to apply early decision. She applied early action to a few schools, including Northeastern, Rutgers, Temple, Drexel, and University of Maryland, and regular decision to Boston University and University of Pennsylvania. She wants to have plenty of options should it not work out for her to attend GW.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Rhea finished her Common Application essay, she was able to easily apply to most of the schools on her list because they didn&#039;t require supplemental essays. While writing additional essays for the schools that required them was challenging—especially while she tried to balance application work with her school work—fortunately her older sister was available to help by providing feedback and editing the essays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to financial aid, Rhea&#039;s mother was a great help. Together, they completed the FAFSA and the CSS PROFILE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhea’s work with FBLA continued with an exciting opportunity to attend the FBLA National Leadership Conference. This was the first time she had been away from her family for an extended period of time. While it was a bit daunting, she said it was a very positive experience, and it gave her a taste of what it would be like to attend college. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the conference she and a fried had to create their own small business, including a 30-page business plan outlining all the aspects of the business and how to run it. At the end of the week, they presented this plan to a board of judges. It was hard work, but Rhea got a lot of satisfaction from it and enjoyed working with her friend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Rhea headed into the final stretch of senior year, she had anything but senioritis. In addition to taking four AP courses, she was gearing up for the Project Hope fundraiser, attending New Jersey’s Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) State Leadership Conference, and participating in the Relay for Life. She was also practicing for her band trip to Disney World in April, looking ahead to her senior trip to Dorney Park in Allentown, PA, and last but not least,  preparing for senior prom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Vice President of Community at FBLA, Rhea&#039;s main focus in the spring was on their Project Hope event. Originally, the event was going to support the March of Dimes, but the team ulitmately decided to go with a New Jersey-based charity called &lt;a href=&quot;http://abirthdaywish.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A Birthday Wish&lt;/a&gt; instead. This organization provides foster children with cards and gifts on their birthday to let them know they are special; they also work to raise awareness of the need for foster parents so more children can be placed in loving homes. Much of Rhea&#039;s time was spent on the public relations aspect of Project Hope, drawing attention to the event and getting sponsors.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But back to the college search: Rhea was accepted to all but one of the schools she applied to. While she may not have gotten in to Boston University, she did get into George Washington University—her top choice—as well as Rutgers University, Temple University, Drexel University, and the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhea was on the fence as she narrowed down her choice to two: Drexel University and GW. After a final visit to Drexel University at the end of April, Rhea was ready to make her final decision. In the end, while she was very familiar with Drexel (her sister has been enrolled there for the past five years), she felt like GW was best suited to what she was looking for in a college. This fall she will be headed to Washington, D.C. as a proud Colonial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though it was difficult balancing college applications with her school work and extracurricular activities, Rhea says she didn&#039;t feel overwhelmed by the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Besides writing the essays, applying to college was not as stressful as I expected,” she told me. “Prior to applying, I had done my research on which universities provided me with the specific curriculum I was looking for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process of applying for financial aid, however, was a bit of a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although I have an older sister who went through the entire college planning process, it still felt like a brand new experience to my parents. That was definitely the most challenging part,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late spring, following her participation in the NJ state FBLA conference, Rhea wrapped up her FBLA responsibilities for the year; she took part in competition and supported her friend in her campaign for state office.  And the Project Hope event she organized for her FBLA chapter was a resounding success—it raised more than $1,000 for A Birthday Wish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With AP Exams in May, Rhea spent most of her free time getting ready. She practiced with friends, and even listened to a podcast that her AP Statistics teacher created for each chapter of their textbook to help her and her classmates study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she’s anxious to step foot on campus in the fall—the result of all her hard work the last few years—Rhea knows she’s ready to tackle a new challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m super excited to live in a completely new city freshman year and study a major that I am so passionate about,” she said. “I’m a little nervous being so far away from home and meeting so many new people, but I’m confident that I will adjust just fine after a few weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Senior Year Chronicles: Rhea&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

This installment of the “Senior Year Chronicles” summarizes Desirée Beach&#039;s conversations with Logan from Virginia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genuine. Dedicated. Astute. Compassionate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atypical words to describe teenagers—but then again, there is &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; typical about Logan Love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From our initial discussion last year, it was evident our meet-and-greet was going to take longer than the arranged 30-minute video chat. Why? Because I was so intrigued by this young man who is making great strides to effect change. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as his last name implies, Logan, a then 17-year-old senior at Patriot High School in Gainesville, Virginia, is driven by his love of helping others. What is most impressive about his desire to help is his authentic, altruistic nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve always known I wanted to help people,” Logan enthusiastically told me, so it’s not the least bit surprising that he logged over 200 hours of community service. As an active member of Key Club International (the high school affiliate of Kiwanis International, an organization aimed at serving children worldwide), his volunteerism ranged from helping the nurses in the ER at a nearby hospital to tutoring 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; graders at a local elementary school on a weekly basis.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When not giving back to his community, Logan was extremely involved in making new students feel welcome at school. As a member of the Pioneer Ambassador Club, he and other members helped mentor all incoming students (freshmen through seniors) in a unique way: He, like the other club members, would send text messages and have lunch with these new students, all in effort to provide more opportunities for the newbies to make “more emotional connections with people” and ultimately create new friendships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Logan’s dedication to school is evident, he admitted the demands “can be overwhelming,” at times. It is, however, the support of his parents—coupled with his aspiration to be the first in his family to attend college—that helped him stay positive and motivated. “Family involvement is so crucial to laying the foundation for success,” he noted, so it’s no wonder why Logan credits his parents for being integral to his accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked further about his driving force to attend college, he was quick to acknowledge the downside of potentially not having a college degree—“having the degree gives [you] credibility,” but not having it “restricts you financially and also [prevents you] from having choices and opportunities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logan took his SATs twice (including the redesigned SAT that he found to be “so much better”), and he submitted his first college application to Florida State University (his top choice) in October; he then submitted four more in November. Ideally, he hoped to be part of Florida State’s combined BA/MA degree program, so he could earn degrees in Political Science and Public Policy (an interest sparked by his previous AP World History and AP U.S. History courses). And while he had made a list of other schools, both in- and out-of-state, at the end of the day, his decision would be incumbent upon where he would get the most scholarships and aid.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By December, with half of his senior year almost behind him and two college acceptances in-hand—including his previous top-choice of Florida State—Logan was feeling anything but senioritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His successes inside and outside of the classroom no doubt played a likely role in his early acceptances to Florida State University and Jacksonville University, and though Logan initially had his eyes set on FSU, a visit to American University in D.C. appeared to have put a wrench in his plan to end up in the warmth of the sunshine state after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, Logan applied for early action “for the ease of mind”— waiting, like some of his peers, until March was not an option. “It would bring on too much anxiety,” he said, and ultimately not allow him the flexibility to make a solid decision. Compared then to other students who hadn’t yet applied, he felt pretty at ease and confident about his applications. “My hard work in a way has paid off,” he said, but noted he was “less confident with having choices because of money.” Since funding for higher education was a chief concern, Logan decided early action would give his family enough time to plan things out as well as provide him with more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter American University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a campus visit, Logan was very enthusiastic about the school. “I liked the campus; it felt like a community, and [I’m very] interested.” Aside from the overall campus feel, American offers an Interdisciplinary Studies major that covers communication, economics, legal institutions, and government, all things about which he is “passionate and interested.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logan considered applying for Early Decision in an attempt increase his chances for admission, but if he were accepted the decision would have been binding. With Logan concerned about the financial implications of a binding early admission, he decided that in addition to applying to James Madison University, Georgia State University, and Flagler College, he would apply for regular decision with American University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Logan worked on his college applications, his dad busily tackled the FAFSA and the CSS PROFILE. Said Logan, “My dad likes to do the money stuff, so he completed it [FAFSA] in less than hour [and] didn’t seem to have a problem with it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Logan, the stress wasn’t so much about the applications themselves but more the financial strain his higher education might cause his parents. “The hardest part has been…[realizing] the cost of college and [knowing] how to pay for it. Everyone knows it’s expensive, but no one tells you how much.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After wrapping up his first semester, Logan found himself on the easier, “less stressful” end of senior year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By then he had received acceptances from Jacksonville University, Georgia State University, James Madison University, and Florida State University. What’s more, he was awarded $22K from Jacksonville and had his out-of-state tuition waived for Georgia State. With all of these options before him, his initial trepidation of being accepted to these schools was quickly replaced with the uncertainty and anxiety of making the right decision based on finances.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The money is just so daunting,” he said. For that reason, he felt that he would most likely decline JMU and American, even if he were accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Logan’s Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) club sponsor quelled his fears and assured him many individuals currently working for the Pentagon—a possible career goal for Logan—attended Florida State University. And, while he only received $1,000 and no scholarship or financial aid from Florida State University, Logan would be eligible for in-state tuition since his father had recently relocated to Florida for work and he and his mother would move soon after graduation. As a result, Florida State went back to the top of Logan’s college list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to scouring the Internet for scholarships, Logan was hard at work preparing for his AP US Government and AP Biology exams, and self-studied for AP Comparative Government because he thought, “Why not!”  And, since much curriculum review didn’t take place in the classroom, he depended on various study books and apps on his phone to stay on target. It wasn’t long before the importance of doing well on these exams shifted for Logan from “getting a good score because [he] thought it helped with college admissions” to understanding the impact of saving money by “seeing what courses [he] wouldn’t need to take at a university.”   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As graduation came closer, Logan was far from experiencing the ubiquitous senior feelings of confusion and alarm. With several college acceptances under his belt, he was riding high and was excited about the remainder of senior year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t all good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much to his (and my) dismay, though Logan was accepted to American University, his request for additional financial aid was denied. That left a typically upbeat and positive Logan feeling—and sounding—a bit dejected. “It’s frustrating, knowing that even though I accomplished a lot, it’s still not enough.”    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we talked through his frustrations, I reminded him of a tremendous accomplishment he was overlooking—he had been admitted to each of the six universities to which he applied, awarded scholarships from many, and admitted into various honors programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after the “pep-talk,” Logan’s somewhat despondent tone switched to excitement when he finally declared, “I’m going to FSU!” Logan believes everything happens for a reason, and that ultimately attending Florida State University will give him a greater chance to shine and make an impact.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked about what he is most excited and/or worried about for his upcoming freshman year, Logan expressed confidence and optimism that the transition will be an easy one and “nothing [he] can’t handle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on what we’ve seen of Logan Love thus far, I don’t think there is much this young man won’t be able to conquer!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Senior Year Chronicles: Logan&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

This installment of the “Senior Year Chronicles” summarizes Crystal Barrick&#039;s conversations with Morgan from Georgia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t remember &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;playing violin,” Morgan told me during our first conversation. She started when she was three years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But three years ago, shortly after moving to John’s Creek, Georgia, from Chicago, she almost quit. “I was bored of it,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, a serendipitous encounter with the John’s Creek High School orchestra teacher (and a quick glimpse of poster for the group’s upcoming trip to Italy) changed her mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan has since traveled quite a bit, and she is now president of the orchestra club. She helps organize the “Bigs and Littles” program, in which upper class students mentor their younger peers. “You don’t just learn about bass or cello,” she said. “You talk about your classes, teachers, and clubs, too. There’s a lot of travel and rehearsals, and a lot of bonding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the past year following Morgan’s senior year of high school as she navigated AP classes, college applications, prom, and plenty of other high school milestones. As a member of the College Board’s Youth Advisory Council, she was gracious enough to shed some light on the busy life of a current high school student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the orchestra club, Morgan’s other social center is the debate team. She stumbled upon the club at an activities fair her freshman year. The deciding factor? “I like to talk!” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researching for the debate team has “opened [her] eyes to the world” through real policy issues, like domestic surveillance and the history of the NSA, and it has also allowed her to travel. Through tournaments and camps, she’s had the opportunity to visit a slew of college campuses in- and out-of-state since her freshman year. When I asked whether this helped with her college search process, she said yes, but not in the way I expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Through social media, I’ve stayed connected to the friends I made,” she told me, and she’s called on them when she’s had questions about college social life, coursework, and faculty. “College websites can tell you anything,” she said, “but these students really know what it’s like.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan has a lot on her plate, but her voice rings with enthusiasm for the future, not stress. She took the SAT twice as a junior and feels good about her scores; she’s done extensive research on scholarships and financial aid; she’s found support in her AP class communities and clubs; and she’s kept herself organized through to-do lists and calendars.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By December of last year, Morgan had sent one batch of Early Action applications, but was waiting to hit &quot;submit&quot; on the rest until she heard from a few schools. Georgetown, Georgia Tech, University of Georgia, Harvard, University of Michigan, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Yale were in her sights; University of Georgia has accepted her, but she had her doubts about Harvard. &quot;I know it’s impossible to get into,&quot; she told me. &quot;Just had to see.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later she emailed me with good news: she got into Harvard. While their admissions office had told students they’d share their decisions by “mid-December,” the ever-updating chatter on College Confidential message boards eventually homed in on December 14. From morning to sunset that day, Morgan refreshed her email inbox and the school’s Facebook and Twitter feeds; a glitch that broke the online portal at 1:00 p.m. heightened her uncertainty. By 5:00 p.m., she said, she had to hole up in the bathroom of the local library where she was volunteering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I had to look in the mirror and tell myself it was going to be okay,” she told me. “I wasn’t freaking out, but I was on edge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, a congratulatory email sealed the deal. Lots of happy crying ensued, and—unsurprisingly to me, after our previous conversations—lots and lots of research. (Full confession: even I teared up when she recounted her story.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying for financial aid was a rockier experience, but Morgan was on top of it. &quot;I completed the FAFSA on October 2, the day after it o​pened, because I had this fear of missing out on financial aid opportunities,&quot; she said. She had some trouble with other parts of the process because she hadn’t heard of the CSS Profile or the IDOC until October, and she was surprised by how much documentation she had to provide. Her peers have been most helpful with this step—her dad went to college in Canada, her mom attended &quot;a smaller local school,&quot; and her school’s guidance department is &quot;fairly weak when it comes to the college application process,&quot; she shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While financial aid packages from  the schools she had been accepted to would play a big role in her college decision-making process, Morgan always had her heart set on Harvard. She fell in love after attending a Harvard-Yale football game last fall, and online sleuthing and conversations with current and admitted students solidified the feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked why the Big H was the right fit, she cited the unparalleled opportunities and resources she’ll have access to, starting her freshman year. While other schools seemed much more “siloed” and hands-off in their approach to business, economics, and public policy studies, Morgan told me, Harvard would let her combine her interests and develop her “think-on-your-feet skills.” The university has an undergraduate-run consulting firm that would not only allow her to travel, compete, and do research—things she’s grown to love through her high school debate team—but also support local nonprofits and startups in a meaningful, practical way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By spring, Morgan had officially made her decision to join Harvard’s class of 2021. While she’s looking forward to life in Cambridge, in the month’s leading up to move-in day she’s soaking up as much of her George life as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She attended her senior prom in a royal blue dress in lieu of visiting Boston for Harvard’s admitted students day. But, because it’s 2017, she wasn’t totally removed from the festivities—&quot;I still watched some of it on a livestream while getting ready,&quot; she admitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AP Exams were among Morgan&#039;s final academic commitments in May. To prepare for her AP Comparative Government, Macroeconomics, Statistics, Spanish, and Literature Exams, she had a few different &lt;a href=&quot;https://groupme.com/en-US/&quot;&gt;group.me&lt;/a&gt; chats going and some study sessions with friends and teachers. And, throughout the year, she kept meticulous outlines and notes. She seemed confident about her upcoming exams—compared to AP Bio and Calculus BC, which she took last year, she felt these wouldn’t require as much “out of school prep.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before graduation, Morgan otherwise kept busy with ceremonies, banquets, and parties. After a “dramatic Phantom of the Opera medley sendoff,” she gave a speech and received a yellow rose at her final orchestra concert; she then planned with her peers and some parent volunteers an end-of-year dinner for her fellow student-musicians. She most looked forward to the “senior carnival,” which fills the John’s Creek High football field with food trucks, games, and well-kept surprises each year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 16 Morgan will fly solo to Boston and then embark on a pre-orientation trip with other Harvard freshman. Though she’s very outdoors-y, she chose a service-oriented trip over hiking or kayaking because it will give her an opportunity to explore Cambridge and help out in her new neighborhood. Her parents will join her a week later for move-in day and orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked if she was nervous about anything, Morgan told me how much she was going to miss her 14-year-old brother. She was heartened by the sentiment that many people (including me) had shared, which is that they eventually felt closer to their siblings after spending some time apart. As a planner, she’s already come up with a strategy for staving off homesickness: a huge photo collage in her dorm room, featuring her brother, her parents, and her orchestra and debate team friends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Senior Year Chronicles: Morgan&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

This installment of the “Senior Year Chronicles” summarizes Sarah Leonard&#039;s conversations with Isabelle from Georgia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes of talking with Isabelle Riddle, a senior at Sequoyah High School in rural Canton, GA, it becomes clear she’s someone who recognizes the importance of balance in her life. Part of this may be due to her after-school life as a dancer (she does everything from pointe to hip-hop), but it also manifests itself in her academic attitude. Her favorite classes senior year were AP Calculus BC, Honors Anatomy, and Visual Art. Isabelle has always loved math, and anatomy is a natural choice given her desire to pursue a career in pediatrics. But art is something new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is my first year taking an artsy class, and I have enjoyed expanding my mind in that way,” she shared. “The class helps to relieve stress, and I am learning basic art skills that everyone should know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to taking a rigorous course load, Isabelle is a member of the College Board’s Youth Advisory Council, and she is involved in training her Labradoodle, Chloe, to be a therapy dog. “She’ll be able to go [to] libraries, hospitals, nursing homes. I’m hoping to take her into pediatric settings, [which would give] me some experience working in medical settings. I think it’s a great idea to combine dogs, which I love, children, and medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little over a month into her senior year, Isabelle was excited about the college application process. “It’s exciting to know that I will attend one of the schools I am applying to now in less than a year,” she said. (On her list: Duke, Emory, Georgia Tech, Harvard, University of Georgia, and Yale). “These senior year steps determine my life’s trajectory in a way, and it is cool—and a little scary—to be making those decisions right now.” However, this great excitement was also her greatest worry—particularly, finding the right college “fit.” “There are so many colleges with so many programs and so many factors to consider that I feel like I can’t make an informed decision about which school would be right for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, one thing Isabelle was less worried about was financial aid, thanks to her involvement with QuestBridge, a scholarship program for high-achieving, low-income students. QuestBridge hosts an annual conference focused on the college admissions process, teaching students about preparing a college application and financial aid processes. Isabelle participated in their College Match program, which grants application fee waivers and full scholarships to some of the most selective institutions in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through her involvement with the program, Isabelle realized that her diversity (she is Native American) is an asset “because I can bring a distinct perspective to a college campus.” She added, “QuestBridge also helped me realize that my income doesn’t have to hold me back. It is important for low-income Native students to understand that there are other options out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By December 2016, Isabelle had applied to four of six schools (Emory, Georgia Tech, University of Georgia, and Yale) and was in the process of finishing applications for Duke and Harvard. Excitingly, she had already been accepted to the University of Georgia and was awarded an academic scholarship!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The planning and research Isabelle put into her college search process could be a model for other students. “I tried to look at several factors when deciding on my college list,” she explained. “I tried to go for a good mix of schools—some close to home, some far away; some reach, some match, and some safety schools; some engineering/research, some liberal arts focused.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the application process was about what she expected, other aspects of college-going were more daunting. Isabelle was able to tour a couple of college campuses, visiting her sister at Harvard and attending a summer program at Yale. “I wish I could get to know every campus I’m applying to in this way!” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other thing she found challenging was the financial aid application process—in particular, juggling college applications with scholarship applications, FAFSA, and CSS PROFILE. While she received a QuestBridge scholarship for juniors in 2016, there was no guarantee that she would receive a scholarship in 2017, and even if she did, the amount awarded varies by institution. As a back-up plan, Isabelle applied to several national scholarships, including Jack Kent Cooke, Ronald McDonald, and Coca Cola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By February 2017, Isabelle had exciting news on both the admissions and scholarship fronts. She was accepted into Georgia Tech and Yale, bringing her college acceptances to three (she was previously accepted at the University of Georgia), and she had secured $1,000 from the Coca Cola Scholars Foundation. She was now one of 250 finalists vying for 150 $20,000 awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isabelle was eagerly waiting for April 1, when she would hear from four other institutions: Duke, Harvard, Princeton, and Vanderbilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, Isabelle thought fall of her senior year would be busy applying for college admission and scholarship awards. Spring, she figured, would be more relaxing. But as a semi-finalist or finalist for several scholarships, she was now entering interview season, and she had three interviews in February: one for Georgia Tech’s Presidential Scholar Program, one for the Coca Cola scholarship, and one for the University of Georgia Foundation Fellowship scholarship (the latter two in the same weekend!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was also busy preparing for AP Exams; she took five this year (Calculus BC, English Literature and Composition, Microeconomics, Physics C: Mechanics, and U.S. Government and Politics). While her teachers administered spring practice exams and after school review sessions, Isabelle was a little worried about retaining information from her fall-semester Microeconomics class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with all of these accomplishments, Isabelle was still a high school senior, which meant dealing with a mild case of senioritis. “I think mostly I’m starting to feel burnt out and tired of doing homework and studying,” she said, which was understandable given her rigorous course load and the extra demands of the college search and application process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a whirlwind spring, Isabelle finally had a chance to catch her breath and celebrate her remarkable achievements. One of those achievements was being accepted at all nine universities to which she applied: Duke, Emory, Georgia Tech, Harvard, MIT, Princeton, the University of Georgia, Vanderbilt, and Yale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really never expected to be able to say that [I got into all nine schools], but I am so happy it’s true!” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing among the nation’s top institutions is daunting, but Isabelle took a pragmatic approach and made a pro-con list, narrowing her choices to two: Harvard and the University of Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Both schools have positives and negatives, so the decision has been really tough even though I know they are both great options,” she reasoned. “Some of the biggest things I’m looking for in my college are pre-med advising programs, research opportunities, and a student body that is passionate about learning and doing whatever it is they like doing. I’m still trying to decide if I want to be far away from or near home, though.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, Isabelle’s pro and con list helped her make her decision. This fall, she’ll be a University of Georgia Bulldog. &quot;The travel, research, and individual mentoring opportunities were too much to pass up. I am looking forward to next year!&quot; she shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these stellar acceptances, Isabelle also amassed a tremendous amount of funding through scholarships and financial aid packages. She ended up winning one of the coveted $20,000 Coca Cola Scholarships, joining 149 other young people nationwide in earning this honor. However, because of the generous financial aid she received in the form of UGA&#039;s Foundation Fellowship, Isabelle plans to save the scholarship money for medical school. Perhaps the most important aspect of her financial aid awards, especially after all the hours she logged with applications and interviews, is that “no school was totally unreasonable” for her to attend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My family’s financial situation won’t hold me back from going wherever I want to college, which I think is how it should be,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking toward the future, Isabelle is excited to switch up her routine in college. “I think a new set of people and places will refresh me,” she said, adding that she’s also excited to start focusing on her primary area of interest, biology. Isabelle closed by saying, “I have really come to admire all that the College Board does through serving on the Youth Advisory Council, and I am so thankful for y’all.” After corresponding with her for the past several months, I’d say the feeling is mutual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Senior Year Chronicles: Isabelle&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Read the original release on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/must-read-student-reactions-following-first-administration-of-the-new-sat-300231441.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PR Newswire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March 5, 2016  -- Today hundreds of thousands of students across the country took the first national administration of the redesigned SAT®. Changes to the test include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A focus on the areas of math that matter most&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An emphasis on more relevant vocabulary words&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No penalty for guessing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An optional essay&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The College Board conducted a survey of 8,089 students who completed the March SAT administration earlier today. We compared this year&#039;s results for some of the same questions to the responses of 6,494 examinees during the identical timeframe after the March 2015 SAT administration. Below you&#039;ll find student reactions to test content, information on how they prepared for the test, and some fun facts about their test day experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Test Content&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of students had positive reactions to taking the new SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;71% of students said the test reflected what they&#039;re learning in school.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;By a 6 to 1 margin, students said they preferred the format of the new SAT over the previous version of the test.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;75% of students said the Reading Test was the same as or easier than they expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;80% of students said the vocabulary on the test would be useful to them later in life, compared with 55% in March 2015.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;59% of students said the Math section tests the skills and knowledge needed for success in college and career.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Preparation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the test&#039;s redesign, the College Board partnered with Khan Academy® to offer free, personalized test practice to all students. Since the resources launched in June 2015, more than 900,000 students have taken advantage of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compared with March 2015 SAT administration, there was a 19% decrease in the number of students that paid for test prep resources.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nearly half of all examinees who took the SAT today prepared with Khan Academy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;98% of examinees who prepared with Khan Academy found it extremely, very, or somewhat helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fun Facts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to know what students ate before taking the test? Here&#039;s what they had to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;3 hot cakes with maple syrup, one sausage patty, and a hash brown.&quot; –Nhan, 16, NC&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Sunny side up eggs with cayenne pepper on oat nut bread toast.&quot; –Alex, 17, PA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;An English muffin with butter and peanut butter and a banana with coffee.&quot; –Stephanie, 18, PA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avocado on corn tortilla, and a pumpkin protein bar.&quot; –Kelly, 17, IL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s how students said they&#039;re celebrating after completing the SAT:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I performed a rendition of &lt;span&gt;Aretha Franklin&#039;s&lt;/span&gt; hit single &#039;Think (Freedom).&#039;&quot; –Matthew, 17, PA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I&#039;m going to treat myself with ice cream.&quot;–Ramis, 16, FL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Order Chinese food and go rock climbing.&quot; –Lawrence, 16, VA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many SAT-takers listened to music to focus before the test. Here are their favorite songs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.    &quot;Work&quot; by Rihanna &lt;br /&gt;1.    &quot;Love Yourself&quot; by &lt;span&gt;Justin Bieber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.    &quot;7 Years&quot; by &lt;span&gt;Lukas Graham&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3.    &quot;Stressed Out&quot; by Twenty One Pilots &lt;br /&gt;4.    &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; by Zayn &lt;br /&gt;5.    &quot;Sorry&quot; by &lt;span&gt;Justin Bieber&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;6.    &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; by Eminem &lt;br /&gt;7.    &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot; by Survivor &lt;br /&gt;8.    &quot;River Flows In You&quot; by Yiruma&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;In Their Own Words&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I felt I was academically ready and knew the format and general difficulty of the test.&quot; –Samuel 17, NJ&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I would describe it as taking any test that you would take at school. It&#039;s also like taking the PSAT (&lt;span&gt;NMSQT&lt;/span&gt;).&quot; –Jocelyn 17, IN&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Khan Academy was literally a godsend. I have never really been a math-centric person, and so pre-calculus is a little rough. I had already been using Khan Academy and when I hooked up my PSAT (&lt;span&gt;NMSQT&lt;/span&gt;) scores it showed me all of the math I had to review.&quot; –Nicole, 17, NH&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I felt like I had a good amount of time to completely read through the passages and select my answers as well as review some of the ones that were difficult for me.&quot; –Elizabeth, 17, WA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional information about the SAT can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sat.org/new&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the first administration of the new SAT, media outlets had some fun reporting on changes to the 90-year-old exam: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com&quot;&gt; The New York Times &lt;/a&gt; said farewell to obscure vocabulary words with an elegiac crossword puzzle; &lt;a href=&quot;http://time.com/money/4226478/new-sat-vocabulary-changes/&quot;&gt; TIME &lt;/a&gt; released a video of their writers attempting to define “SAT words;” &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/zorn/ct-sat-khan-kaplan-prep-act-perspec-zorn-0221-jm-20160219-column.html&quot;&gt; The Chicago Tribune &lt;/a&gt; bid adieu to the old content and welcomed Khan Academy’s world-class practice resources; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.today.com/video/today-anchors-try-out-the-new-sat-test-637647939772&quot;&gt; Today Show &lt;/a&gt; anchors answered new SAT questions live on the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College Board president David Coleman also talked to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.today.com/video/big-changes-on-the-way-for-the-sats-607455299991&quot;&gt; Today Show &lt;/a&gt; about how free, high-quality SAT practice tools can level the playing field for all students. Stacy Caldwell, vice president of college readiness assessments for the College Board, shared last-minute test-taking tips with students on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/#7ecbfd8c63cd&quot;&gt; Forbes &lt;/a&gt; . Cyndie Schmeiser, chief of assessment, talked with WBUR’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2016/03/03/new-sat-debuts&quot;&gt; Here and Now &lt;/a&gt; about how the new test focuses on the few things that evidence show matter most for college and career readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in Connecticut, teachers created an Adele parody video, titled “ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.centralctcommunications.com/bristolpress/article_21918f50-dcf9-11e5-bce6-f3e7d171bd45.html&quot;&gt; Hello SAT &lt;/a&gt; ,” to cheer on their students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, students in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-03-04/one-florida-school-district-goes-all-in-on-new-sat&quot;&gt; Florida &lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.today.com/video/big-changes-on-the-way-for-the-sats-607455299991&quot;&gt; New York &lt;/a&gt; , and &lt;a href=&quot;http://wnep.com/2016/03/03/sat-test-revamped-for-high-schoolers/&quot;&gt; Pennsylvania &lt;/a&gt; told reporters they felt confident going into the redesigned SAT; many of them had prepared for it using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt; free practice resources &lt;/a&gt; from the College Board and Khan Academy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of thousands of students finally sat down to take the exam — for free, in their own schools — on March 2, as part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/k12-educators/sat-school-day&quot;&gt; SAT School Day &lt;/a&gt; . The next morning, &lt;em&gt; The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt; announced on the front page that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/03/03/as-sat-enters-a-new-era-this-week-students-say-the-exam-has-improved/&quot;&gt; students said the exam has improved &lt;/a&gt; . And a story from &lt;em&gt; The Associated Press &lt;/em&gt; , which was subsequently picked up by more than 250 national and local outlets, began:  “Not so tricky. More straightforward. Guessing allowed. The newly redesigned SAT college entrance exam that debuts nationally Saturday is getting good reviews from some of the students who took it early this week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands more students across the country took the SAT on Saturday, March 5, and continued to celebrate the changes. Based on results from College Board’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/releases/2016/student-reactions-first-administration-new-sat&quot;&gt; post-administration survey &lt;/a&gt; of more than  8,000 test-takers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.educationworld.com/a_news/19-percent-less-students-pay-sat-test-prep-thanks-college-board-khan-academy-partnership&quot;&gt; Education World &lt;/a&gt; announced that “71 percent of students reportedly said the test reflected what they are learning in school” and “19 percent fewer students are paying for test preparation thanks to the free resources now available to them’’ — namely, Khan Academy.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-03-07-what-do-rihanna-and-oat-nut-bread-toast-have-to-do-with-the-new-sat&quot;&gt; EdSurge &lt;/a&gt; shared how students got ready for the test, revealing what they ate for breakfast and what songs they listened to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few students took to Twitter with their successes:    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/OfficialSAT&quot;&gt;@OfficialSAT &lt;/a&gt; I really liked the new SAT!&lt;/p&gt;— E (@edgarjimenezlun) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/edgarjimenezlun/status/706175245812637696&quot;&gt; March 5, 2016 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CollegeBoard&quot;&gt;@CollegeBoard &lt;/a&gt; I absolutely ADORED the articles in the Reading section. There were some really scrumptious pieces - especially in science.&lt;/p&gt;— Lucia Stark (@LuciaStark8) March 5, 2016&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was sick... Can I do it again?????? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CollegeBoard&quot;&gt; @CollegeBoard &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— molly (@mollyolo) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mollyolo/status/706179773496737792&quot;&gt; March 5, 2016 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the heels on these positive reactions, David Coleman and Sal Khan had one more big announcement to make this week: more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2016/03/09/students-sat-free-prep/81567104/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; 1 million users &lt;/a&gt; have practiced for the SAT through Khan Academy, and the number is growing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Students — and Reporters — Ring in the Redesigned SAT &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>More Than One Million Students Have Taken Advantage of Free, Personalized SAT Practice </title>

That’s four times the number of students who pay for commercial prep test each year, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2016/03/09/students-sat-free-prep/81567104/&quot;&gt; USA Today &lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the College Board’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/releases/2016/student-reactions-first-administration-new-sat&quot;&gt; post-administration survey &lt;/a&gt;  of students, almost half of all SAT test-takers on March 5 used the Official SAT Practice to prepare, compared to the 10% who used commercial test prep. That means 19% fewer students have paid for SAT prep resources this year alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data show that the free resources are reaching students across all races, ethnicities, and income-levels, creating a more level playing field. “More students, whatever their level of income, are preparing for the SAT with Khan Academy than with all commercial test prep combined — at every level of income,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2016/03/09/students-sat-free-prep/81567104/&quot;&gt; Coleman said at the annual SXSWedu conference &lt;/a&gt;  on Wednesday. “Never in my career have I seen a launch of technology at this scale that has broken down the racial divisions that so haunt this nation — never.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Khan Academy team worked closely with the College Board assessment design team to create practice resources that are aligned with the new test. When students link their College Board and Khan Academy accounts, they receive a personalized plan based on their PSAT/NMSQT scores. Students are encouraged to follow their practice plan to get ready for test day, and so far — from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.today.com/video/big-changes-on-the-way-for-the-sats-607455299991&quot;&gt; New York City &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9qM1eezN-c&quot;&gt; Orlando, Florida &lt;/a&gt; — they are embracing that challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the data, students themselves have spoken about the positive impact of the free practice tools. “Khan Academy was literally a godsend,” said a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/releases/2016/student-reactions-first-administration-new-sat&quot;&gt; student from New Hampshire &lt;/a&gt; . Said a student from Oak Ridge High School: “Honestly, I&#039;d say it is a game. You practice but you don&#039;t notice you&#039;re kinda competing with yourself. It&#039;s fun. I like it a lot.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, we were reminded why free practice on Khan Academy is so critical to our efforts to deliver opportunity to students. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.today.com/video/some-sat-prep-courses-accused-of-charging-students-unfairly-642123331566&quot;&gt; Today Show &lt;/a&gt; aired a segment, based on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/asians-nearly-twice-as-likely-to-get-higher-price-from-princeton-review&quot;&gt;  ProPublica report &lt;/a&gt; , documenting how paid commercial test prep companies are charging students different amounts for their test prep resources. Specifically, Propublica reported that the Princeton Review charges Asian students almost two times as much as non-Asian students, regardless of income or geographic location. The contrast between the free, world-class practice with Khan Academy and the price gauging by commercial test prep companies is stark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board and Khan Academy teamed up to create Official SAT Practice to level the playing field and address the inequities that resulted from the high-priced test prep industry. “Why not aspire to create something so good that even the most affluent who has the payment options will want to use it?” said Khan at SXSWedu. With thousands of interactive problems, video lessons, and more from the creators of the test and Khan Academy, Official SAT Practice is the best way for students to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;More Than One Million Students Have Taken Advantage of Free, Personalized SAT Practice &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;As the moderator of a panel called “Student Voices: Learning from Those We Teach,” Cortes connected us to three outstanding students from high schools that received the Gaston Caperton Opportunity Award this year: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/academic/arroyo-valley-high-school-celebrates-power-hope&quot;&gt;Arroyo Valley High School&lt;/a&gt; in San Bernardino, CA, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://steelerslounge.com/2016/02/broome-high-school-wins-gaston-caperton-opportunity-award/595535/&quot;&gt;Gettys D. Broome High School&lt;/a&gt; in Spartanburg, SC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some of the insights they had to offer. (Quotes have been lightly edited and condensed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortes&lt;/strong&gt;: What keeps you motivated to graduate and go to college?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria Velasco, senior at Arroyo Valley High School&lt;/strong&gt;: My motivation now is definitely not wanting to let all of my teachers&#039; efforts go to waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortes&lt;/strong&gt;: Have you had to overcome any obstacles in high school?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alicia Poole, senior at Gettys D. Broome High School&lt;/strong&gt;: As an introvert, I found that my personality has hindered my learning experience a lot, because I didn’t ask questions in class andI didn’t verbally participate. I also tend to take on more than I can handle. Unfortunately, in my junior and senior years of high school, I had to drop an AP class because I could not handle the workload. At the time I did really feel like a failure, but I really realized the value of knowing what I can and can’t handle. Now I can better manage my AP classes and it has led to greater success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortes&lt;/strong&gt;: Do you feel academically prepared for college? Or, if you don’t feel prepared, what do you wish your high school or college should do more of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maddie Norton, senior at Gettys D. Broome High School&lt;/strong&gt;: I feel really prepared for college, especially because of my AP courses. I am in AP Biology, AP Calculus, AP English Literature, and AP English Language. When I go off to college, if I score well, which I believe I will, I know that I can skip the freshman courses that are required and go straight to classes that pertain to my major… I think my school would benefit if we really push AP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortes&lt;/strong&gt;: How would you describe process of finding the right college for you? What could have made it easier?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Velasco&lt;/strong&gt;: I really haven’t found the college for me yet, but I narrowed it down to USC and UCLA. I got to that point by taking a lot of factors into consideration, like average class size, location, and research opportunities. But I am really stuck between the two and so I resorted to asking my peers, teachers, and coordinators for advice. The problem was, rather than getting advice from them, I was getting an opinion, and that makes students’ decisions very difficult. I think it is important for parents, teachers, whomever to understand that just because a school might be the most prestigious in the country or the state, it’s not necessarily best for that student. There is not a right college, but there is a right college for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortes&lt;/strong&gt;: What is one piece of advice to educators in the audience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norton&lt;/strong&gt;: I always know that I have the possibility to go to one of my teachers and talk to them. Create this connection with your students — have the time, make the time to go out and just be friends, keep the student relationship. Create this friendship so they know that they are not alone, because you don’t know what is going on in their lives. That’s how you are going to get your students to go to class, to enjoy and engage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poole&lt;/strong&gt;: “Encouragement is very important because I think it is really easy for student to give up. When they are taking four, five, even six AP classes at a time, they may just want to give up. For example, at the beginning of the year, I was signed up to AP Calculus and I said no, I am not doing that, not Calculus, definitely not AP — but my teacher sat down with me and she told me scoring is not the most important thing. “If you take this class and you don’t score, I promise you will be still prepared for college,” she said. Now I am in AP Calculus, and I think I’ll definitely score thanks to the encouragement and support I got from my teacher. I think it’s important for teachers to realize students need as much support as they can get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;AP Student Panel: Lessons from Those We Teach&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

At Prepárate, attendees heard first-hand from six inspiring Latina students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students —from The Young Women’s Leadership Network &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ywln.org/college-prep&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CollegeBound Initiative&lt;/a&gt; and The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ywln.org/all-girls-school&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Young Women’s Leadership Schools&lt;/a&gt; in New York City, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sbcusd.com/index.aspx?nid=341&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Arroyo Valley High School&lt;/a&gt; in San Bernadino, CA, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rutgers.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rutgers University&lt;/a&gt; in New Brunswick, NJ —  shared their passion for STEM, praised their mentors and support systems, and asked the more than 100 educators in attendance to encourage their students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young women drew plenty of well-earned praise for their stories and successes. Several audience members were so moved that they were brought to tears, and many took to social media to share their thoughts. Here are some highlights from this powerful panel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I didn&#039;t have a Latina coder to look up to, so I want to be that for younger girls&quot; - incredible HS student. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Preparate16?src=hash&quot;&gt;#Preparate16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jennifer Rosenthal (@jenn_rosenthal) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Adults told me to do what they hadn&#039;t done...

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As young Latinas, we need to take this step to show those coming behind us that they can achieve higher education.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/YWLN1&quot;&gt;@YWLN1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Preparate16?src=hash&quot;&gt;#Preparate16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— College Board Forums (@CB_Forums) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latinas in education: The more educated we are, the more empowered ... Makes us free!- Diana Gonzalez &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Preparate16?src=hash&quot;&gt;#Preparate16&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;— LatinoUCollegeAccess (@LatinoUAccess)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over estimate instead of under estimate our brilliant, brave Latina/o/x students! ❤️&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Preparate16?src=hash&quot;&gt;#Preparate16&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CollegeBoard&quot;&gt;@CollegeBoard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Lorena (@MsLorenaMarquez) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As women, our voice is often silenced. Especially as Latinas we don&#039;t get empowered so we need to make sure to encourage others &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Preparate16?src=hash&quot;&gt;#Preparate16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Lorena (@MsLorenaMarquez) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These high school, undergraduate, and graduate students shared why education matters to them, discussed their families and communities, and described how high-quality learning opportunities — with academically rigorous programming and social-emotional supports — can empower Native students to pursue and thrive in college. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside a small cabin in Viareggio, Italy, is the sound of the Ligurian Sea dancing around the littoral rocks, while inside you are enjoying the breakfast of a nice, warm, buttery jam-filled cornetti, accompanied by a steaming cup of Italian coffee. With open windows, you enjoy the breeze from the coast and the smell of a rich culture. Mmmm…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few months ago you were accepted into that college you were dying to get into. And, like Florida weather, you haphazardly changed your mind and decided to instead defer and take a gap year before attending. Good or bad decision?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students take a gap year for many different reasons. The months before college can be the perfect time for students to experience a different culture, learn a new language, volunteer for a cause they feel strongly about, or possibly explore their career interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gap experience, which can be as short as a few months or as long as a year, is pretty commonplace in areas such as Europe and Australia, but not so much in the U.S. While it has become something of a recent fad in the states, students often still get that queasy stomach feeling and a lump in their throats when trying to decide if taking a gap year is the best decision for their future. Can you blame them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think back to when you were in high school, to the struggles you may have faced. High school is a stressful time. You spend four long years trying to be the best, then months in the tedious and befuddling process of completing college applications and financial aid information (and let’s not forget the crying that goes along with this). Then, you finally get accepted — only to push it off for a year? Makes no sense, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As Americans, we’ve become conditioned to understand our pathway as completing high school, attending college &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; after, and then finding a great paying job. While for some students taking a detour from college could mean falling off the education wagon completely, a gap year goes a long way to ensuring some students recognize that there is a life after high school that is not college. Sometimes, it’s nice to get away from the academic grind and take a break.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://americangap.org/data-benefits.php&quot;&gt;American Gap Association&lt;/a&gt;, 90 percent of students who take a gap year attend or returned to college within a year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many people think only students from wealthy families can take advantage of  a gap year. In fact, there are many organizations, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.carpemundi.org/&quot;&gt;Carpe Mundi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalcitizenyear.org/&quot;&gt;Global Citizen Year&lt;/a&gt;, that offer full or partial scholarships and other financial aid to high school graduates. These organizations offer the chance to participate in work-related educational travel and other programs during a gap year so that students can learn through cultural immersion and exploration. Anecdotal evidence often shows that we develop most when the world around us changes, because our understanding of ourselves also changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taking a gap year encourages students to get out of their comfort zone, because this is the perfect time to test their limits, meet different people, and immerse themselves in completely different cultures. It is a time to take chances and to make mistakes. Many students enter college because they are comfortable with the idea of college. They fail to realize that just because something is uncomfortable doesn’t mean that they can’t do it. They just haven’t taken the time to explore that option yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider using a gap year as an opportunity to “deschool” but &lt;em&gt;rediscover &lt;/em&gt;learning. So much of the school experience is encased in a room surrounded by four walls and a few windows, while someone lectures you on the Principles of Modern Urodynamic studies, Regiomontanus&#039; Angle Maximization problem, Solubility and Electrochemistry, or even English 101. A gap year can help students go beyond those walls, figure out their place in the world, and see how they are only a small part of something much larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My message to students: A gap year gives you the chance to smoothly transition between two different life phases, while at the same time trying to figure out who you are, what you want to accomplish, and what you next step(s) in life will be. It’s a time to reflect and take a deep breath and realize all of your hard work. It’s a time for self-actualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you’re wondering if I took a gap year. Actually, I didn’t. Looking back on it, I don’t regret it either. At that time, I only had one thing on my mind, and that was to finish what I started. The pressure from my family and friends and everyone who supported me was too much to bear. To me, a gap year seemed like an easy “out.” I didn’t want to be like the people I saw when I walked to school every morning. There was a fire inside me that just made my desire to continue through college, burn more and more —with an increasing, yet positive, ferocity. I welcomed every challenge and minor setback with open arms, because in the end, I learned who I was and what I was capable of. I found myself — even without the benefit of a gap year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Johnathan Allen will graduate from the University of Central Florida in 2017 with a Bachelor of Science in Business Adminstration. He was a cast member in the documentary film, &lt;a href=&quot;http://roadtripnation.com/watch/index&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Roadtrip Nation&lt;/a&gt;, and he has done two summer internships at the College Board.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Leap (a School) Year&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
