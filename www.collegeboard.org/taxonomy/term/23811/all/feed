That’s four times the number of students who pay for commercial prep test each year, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2016/03/09/students-sat-free-prep/81567104/&quot;&gt; USA Today &lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the College Board’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/releases/2016/student-reactions-first-administration-new-sat&quot;&gt; post-administration survey &lt;/a&gt;  of students, almost half of all SAT test-takers on March 5 used the Official SAT Practice to prepare, compared to the 10% who used commercial test prep. That means 19% fewer students have paid for SAT prep resources this year alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data show that the free resources are reaching students across all races, ethnicities, and income-levels, creating a more level playing field. “More students, whatever their level of income, are preparing for the SAT with Khan Academy than with all commercial test prep combined — at every level of income,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2016/03/09/students-sat-free-prep/81567104/&quot;&gt; Coleman said at the annual SXSWedu conference &lt;/a&gt;  on Wednesday. “Never in my career have I seen a launch of technology at this scale that has broken down the racial divisions that so haunt this nation — never.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Khan Academy team worked closely with the College Board assessment design team to create practice resources that are aligned with the new test. When students link their College Board and Khan Academy accounts, they receive a personalized plan based on their PSAT/NMSQT scores. Students are encouraged to follow their practice plan to get ready for test day, and so far — from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.today.com/video/big-changes-on-the-way-for-the-sats-607455299991&quot;&gt; New York City &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9qM1eezN-c&quot;&gt; Orlando, Florida &lt;/a&gt; — they are embracing that challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the data, students themselves have spoken about the positive impact of the free practice tools. “Khan Academy was literally a godsend,” said a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/releases/2016/student-reactions-first-administration-new-sat&quot;&gt; student from New Hampshire &lt;/a&gt; . Said a student from Oak Ridge High School: “Honestly, I&#039;d say it is a game. You practice but you don&#039;t notice you&#039;re kinda competing with yourself. It&#039;s fun. I like it a lot.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, we were reminded why free practice on Khan Academy is so critical to our efforts to deliver opportunity to students. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.today.com/video/some-sat-prep-courses-accused-of-charging-students-unfairly-642123331566&quot;&gt; Today Show &lt;/a&gt; aired a segment, based on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/asians-nearly-twice-as-likely-to-get-higher-price-from-princeton-review&quot;&gt;  ProPublica report &lt;/a&gt; , documenting how paid commercial test prep companies are charging students different amounts for their test prep resources. Specifically, Propublica reported that the Princeton Review charges Asian students almost two times as much as non-Asian students, regardless of income or geographic location. The contrast between the free, world-class practice with Khan Academy and the price gauging by commercial test prep companies is stark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board and Khan Academy teamed up to create Official SAT Practice to level the playing field and address the inequities that resulted from the high-priced test prep industry. “Why not aspire to create something so good that even the most affluent who has the payment options will want to use it?” said Khan at SXSWedu. With thousands of interactive problems, video lessons, and more from the creators of the test and Khan Academy, Official SAT Practice is the best way for students to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;More Than One Million Students Have Taken Advantage of Free, Personalized SAT Practice &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
