At the event, they also highlighted the City’s AP for All Initiative, first announced in 2015, to ensure that 75 percent of high school students will have access to at least five AP classes by fall 2018 and all high school students will have access by fall 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EzV0_Z8_4Ls? autoplay=0&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the event, Coleman highlighted how New York City’s leadership is “blazing a path for the country, demonstrating how equity and excellence can both be improved together.” He added: “Diversity and excellence can and must go hand in hand. New York’s impressive AP results reinforce a pattern the College Board has seen nationally. The AP Program has grown by one million students over the last 10 years. A researcher from the American Enterprise Institute found that during that period quality was in no way diminished despite the radical advance in access. He calls it the &#039;the single happiest education story of the century.&#039;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sSvk0ufaogA?autoplay=0&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of students taking at least one AP exam rose 8.4 percent from 41,419 to 44,906 students, and the number of students scoring 3 or higher on AP exams rose 8.2 percent. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/026-17/mayor-de-blasio-chancellor-fari-a-highest-ever-number-nyc-students-taking-and&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find out more about the announcement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are shaking the foundation of this system by putting rigorous AP courses in every neighborhood in every borough,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/026-17/mayor-de-blasio-chancellor-fari-a-highest-ever-number-nyc-students-taking-and&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;statement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “By providing the coursework needed for college and careers for all New York City students, we are sending a message that we believe in them and support them on the path to success. The increases in participation and performance we see today – particularly among Black and Hispanic students – show that we’re moving in the direction of equity and excellence, and I look forward to the work ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, we spoke to Kayla Brathwaite, a New York 12th grader who attends East Park High School in Manhattan. Kayla took three AP classes, and even though she hated studying, she loved to learn. She said if you take AP, you&#039;ll be smarter. Kayla&#039;s teacher saw potential in her and signed her up for an AP class. That&#039;s what AP for All is all about, every student with promise should have access to AP, even when they don&#039;t see potential in themselves. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w9pcqagQhU&quot;&gt;Find out more about Kayla&#039;s journey into AP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of AP are real for Medgar Evers Preparatory High School senior Isaiah Mondesir, who has taken eight AP courses already. “The classes were more challenging and helped me push me further,” says Isaiah. “Prior to taking AP, I wasn’t such a critical thinker as I am now.” He says taking AP also helped him define what he wanted to study in college, which is computer science or Sabre security engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Akwasi Agyeman, taking AP has meant a huge boost in confidence. This senior, who is also at Medgar Evers, says before taking AP he was not academically strong, but now “it makes me feel I can do anything.” He is going to Middlebury College on a full scholarship and hopes to delve into the medical or education field. He feels AP “really helped him step outside his comfort zone and think outside the box.” For his AP classes he learned to research topics on the internet and in the library, and to reach out to strangers for more information – all things he was not comfortable doing before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emmy Delormes, a sophomore at the same school, who has taken four AP courses and is taking four more courses, says AP has opened many doors for her. “For some, college seems so far away. Like an impossible dream. AP&#039;s make that dream possible as it helps students develop certain study skills and assets that will be highly beneficial in college.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NYC Students Prepare for First Citywide SAT School Day</title>

&lt;p&gt;“You don’t have to go to the SAT test, it comes to you now,” said &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/198-17/mayor-de-blasio-chancellor-fari-a-celebrate-first-ever-sat-school-day-of-equity-and&quot;&gt;Mayor Bill de Blasio&lt;/a&gt; to a classroom full of students. “We have a great partnership with the College Board for this effort, to make SAT more accessible to all, to really create a college-going culture, in all of our schools.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Monday&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/NYCMayor/videos/vb.22085921165/10155014978901166/?type=2&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;, Mayor de Blasio thanked Shameek Robinson, Director of K-12 for the Middle States Region, who was in attendance on behalf of the College Board.  The Mayor noted how SAT School Day is part of the College Board’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/guidance/access-to-opportunity&quot;&gt;broader efforts&lt;/a&gt; to connect students to college success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As the first person in my family to attend college, I understand how important SAT School Day can be – this is a game-changer,” said Schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña, who shared her own SAT test taking story with students. Her parents, who were immigrants from Spain, did not know what the SAT was, so it was a teacher in her school who registered Chancellor Fariña for the test only days before it was being administered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.queensvoc.org/&quot;&gt;Queens Vocational and Technical High School&lt;/a&gt; spoke about the benefits of taking the SAT during the school day.  Victoria, who is going to the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) in New York to study advertising and marketing, said she had to fill out paperwork to get a fee waiver, go to grandmother’s house to sign up for SAT because she doesn’t have a computer at home, and then take off from work to take the exam on the weekend.  “Because of the the hoops I had jump through, it became very challenging and it made it very discouraging to take the exam,” she said. Another student, Luis, who is going to SUNY Delhi to study architecture, said it was difficult to find a new school to take the exam, adding “going to a new place I haven’t discovered is even more challenging.”  New York City juniors this year will have no obstacles to taking the SAT. Check out the NYC Department of Education SAT School Day video, featuring the Insanity Dance Team &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/210987325&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://i1054.photobucket.com/albums/s490/uvasig/NYC%20SD%20tweet_zpsxzpfzhy8.png&quot; style=&quot;float:left; height:284px; width:450px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By having students take the SAT during the week at their school, students don’t have to arrange for transportation or find an unfamiliar testing site and don’t have to apply for a fee waiver since it is free for all NYC public and charter school juniors.  Also, testing no longer interferes with weekend work or family obligations and it is less stressful because students are familiar with the location and staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving the SAT during the school day fosters a college-going culture and research shows that increasing student access to the SAT results in higher four-year college-going rates.  One &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3102/0162373714521866&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; showed that, by funding SAT for all students, the state of Maine saw 4-year college-going rates rise by 10 percentage points among students who otherwise would not have taken the SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York City students will take the new SAT, which makes it easier for students to show their best work, is aligned to state standards and measures what students are learning in school.  Gone are the so-called SAT words and the penalty for guessing. Students are only tested on relevant math, and there is no separate science section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s much easier for students to prepare with free, personalized study tools from Khan Academy. There’s no need to pay for expensive test prep. Already, more than 3 million unique users have logged on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.satpractice.org/&quot;&gt;Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy&lt;/a&gt;. Data show that the practice platform is reaching students across race, ethnicities and income-levels – mirroring the percentage of SAT test takers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city will also offer the PSAT 10 to all public school sophomores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayor de Blasio, encouraged all students to take SAT no matter what they wanted to do in the future.   “It’s going to be an opportunity to take a test and change your lives for the better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;NYC Students Prepare for First Citywide SAT School Day&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
