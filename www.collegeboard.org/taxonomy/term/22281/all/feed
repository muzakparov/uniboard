    <title>Chancellor Fariña Kicks Off Prepárate</title>

&lt;p&gt;“Our immigrant kids are an asset, not a deficit,” Chancellor Fariña began. “In this global market, we need students who speak more than one language.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chancellor Fariña, who oversees the education of 1.1 million students, told the audience a story about how, when she was in high school, she was forced to take a non-college bound track. Not until a teacher intervened did she get closer to her dream, which was to become a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “We always seem to have some kind of expectation of kids — based on their looks, their last names, or family income. And that’s got to stop,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a daughter of immigrants parents, Chancellor Fariña understood firsthand and early on that parent engagement and support are crucial to college success.  She said that many Latino parents expect their children to help contribute financially to their household after high school, but she wants to help these families understand that allowing children to go to college will help them more in the long run.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During her time as Chancellor, Fariña has developed&lt;a href=&quot;http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/789624F3-C6F0-4A6B-96AC-0E2C91E534F4/0/MasterCalendar44.pdf&quot;&gt; Parent Academies&lt;/a&gt; that help parents learn what to expect when their children get to college. When she realized that many younger students also didn’t know what to expect from college, she implemented &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/NYCschools/videos/10153465778164091/&quot;&gt;“College Awareness Day”&lt;/a&gt; — an annual event in all NYC schools during which teachers and educators wear their college t-shirts and talk to students about their college experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure New York City students get into college and stay there, Fariña also launched a successful alumni program. Once a month, current college freshman are invited to speak to students at their former high school for dinner, mentoring, and college planning. These conversations allow students to learn about the realities of college life and build their alumni network while in high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chancellor Fariña closed her speech by emphasizing the importance of college for underrepresented groups of students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “College is not just about an education in terms of book learning— it’s an education in social networking, it’s an education in thinking about the future, and in finding the people you are going to keep in touch with for the rest of your lives so you support each other,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound advice for all students and parents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Chancellor Fariña Kicks Off Prepárate&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>Florida Partnership Provides National Model for Latino Student Achievement </title>

&lt;p&gt;That strategy - known as the Florida Partnership - took center stage at &lt;a href=&quot;https://preparate.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;Prepárate&lt;/a&gt; 2016 during a conversation between College Board President and CEO David Coleman and two of the current stewards of the initiative, Patricia Levesque and Jesus Jara. Levesque, CEO of the Tallahassee (Fla.) based &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.excelined.org/&quot;&gt;Foundation for Excellence in Education&lt;/a&gt;, and Jara, Deputy Superintendent for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ocps.net/&quot;&gt;Orange County Public Schools&lt;/a&gt;, were on hand to receive the &lt;a href=&quot;https://preparate.collegeboard.org/key-information&quot;&gt;College Board’s Modelo de la Comunidad&lt;/a&gt; award on behalf of the Partnership for its outstanding work improving educational outcomes for Florida’s Latino community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[This partnership] puts the best of the College Board’s resources together with the state of Florida’s best resources,” Coleman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A collaboration between the College Board and the Florida Department of Education, the Partnership is dedicated to improving the academic experience for all students – especially underrepresented students – across the state by connecting assessments (through the PSAT/NMSQT), access to rigorous coursework (through Advanced Placement), and professional development opportunities for educators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its start in 1999 under former governor Jeb Bush, the Florida Partnership has significantly increased access to AP course work for Latino students while also increasing the number of Latino students earning a 3 or higher on AP Exams. In 2000, approximately 6,500 Latino students took AP exams; in 2015, nearly 49,000 Latino students took at least one matched AP exam. The Partnership made a difference not only in expanding the number of students who took an AP exam, but also in their scores. About 5,800 Latino students passed an AP exam in 2000 with a score of 3 or higher; last year, 42,000 Latino students passed at least one AP exam by the same measure. The result is that Florida has become the first state to erase the equity gap in AP for Latino students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Florida is the one place where we’ve seen - at this kind of scale - the closing of the gap between Latino and white students,” Coleman said. “That’s remarkable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Partnership has helped Latino students and their families save more than $112 million in 2015 in college credits earned through AP exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levesque, who worked on Governor Bush’s legislative staff when the Partnership was being formed, said that having a clear vision for what they wanted to accomplish was critical in getting it off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We realized that we didn’t want to just keep students from falling through the cracks, but that we also wanted them to be prepared for college,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, there was an early focus on understanding how PSAT/NMSQT data could help identify underrepresented students who had the potential to excel in AP courses. This information was combined with a sustained professional development effort to help teachers prepare to teach AP in their classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the partnership started to produce results, Governor Bush sought state funding to support the program and found a willing partner in the Florida legislature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was bipartisan support for the partnership because the results where there,” said Jara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other states are now attempting to replicate some of Florida’s successes. Colorado, led by Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper, is working with the Republican legislature to support and pass a bill related to AP Computer Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Levesque and Jara are both advocates of building legislative support to institutionalize programs like the Florida Partnership, they also stressed the importance of parents, educators, and other community actors in creating an atmosphere where students feel as though they can succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need to make sure our parents are educated on what’s available and possible,” said Jara. “The kids know they can do it and we just need to help them get there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Florida Partnership Provides National Model for Latino Student Achievement &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>Preparing Latino Students for College and for Life </title>

&lt;p&gt;The College Board is working to prepare Latino students for success in a number of ways, explained Coleman — by &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat&quot;&gt;redesigning the SAT&lt;/a&gt; and removing the obscure “SAT words” that many Latino students struggled with on the old test; by investing in access to &lt;a href=&quot;https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/exploreap&quot;&gt;AP courses&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/counseling-admissions-academic/news-all-campaign-aims-get-more-latino-students&quot;&gt;AP All In&lt;/a&gt; campaign; and by ensuring that all Latino students get free, world-class &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;SAT preparation&lt;/a&gt; through the College Board’s partnership with Khan Academy. “We now have equal number of Latinos participating in Khan Academy as those participating in the SAT,” he announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An area for improvement, he continued, is to ensure Latino students realize their potential. College Board research shows that 57% of Latino students who have potential to succeed in AP coursework do not participate in at least one matched AP exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a scandal that there are so many Latino students across this country who are ready for academic opportunities who then betray themselves by not taking them,” he said. And unfortunately, that trend continues in college — the number of Latinos who enroll in college is much lower than the number who have the potential to succeed in college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman pointed out that religious communities and schools are key to addressing these issues. “If we are going to speak seriously about moving the Latino community, engaging with families, and getting more students to apply broadly to college,” he told the audience, “how can we ignore the remarkable and central force the religious community has in this conversation?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman invited Dr. Carlos Campo, president of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ashland.edu/administration/president&quot;&gt;Ashland University&lt;/a&gt; in Ohio and chair of the Alliance for Hispanic Education for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nhclc.org&quot;&gt;National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference&lt;/a&gt; (NHCLC), to continue this conversation with him during the first Prepárate plenary session, “Conversations about Reverence and Excellence: Faith and Opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the son of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/25/arts/music/pupi-campo-cuban-bandleader-and-the-rumba-maestro-dies-at-91.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;Cuban bandleader&lt;/a&gt; and a singer from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatentertainersarchives.blogspot.com/2011/11/forgotten-ones-betty-clooney.html&quot;&gt;Clooney Sister Singers&lt;/a&gt; (yes, George Clooney is his cousin!), Dr. Campo admitted he was an unlikely candidate to become president of a university. His parents did not graduate from high school, but they made him believe education was the key to his future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My parents had me look up. They made me believe I could do it, that all things were possible,” said Dr. Campo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He struggled with his Latino identity growing up; not until he started teaching at a community college did he see saw the power of being an educator and the influence he could have on Latino students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I had this feeling that ellos son sus hijos, these are your children — that was a shift for me,” said Dr. Campo about his calling. “These children, they were my neighbor and I had this duty to them and to God. [God] said you will serve me through them, and express your love for me through your love for them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges in higher education, Dr. Campo went on to explain during his conversation with Coleman, is that Latino faculty members willfully do not enter into their institution’s administrations because they want to stay connected to students. The last thing Dr. Campo wanted was to go what he called “the dark side” and become an administrator, but he soon realized that by becoming a college president he would have more opportunities to enact positive change for his Latino students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Dr. Campo wanted to send a message to educators in the audience about their expectations of Latino students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think too often we compromise and say, ‘This is good enough.’ Truly that has been the story of the Latino community for too long in this country,” he explained. “We have to be the ones to say no, never settle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is nothing that feels better than preparing students for college and for life,” Dr. Campo closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Preparing Latino Students for College and for Life &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;As the moderator of a panel called “Student Voices: Learning from Those We Teach,” Cortes connected us to three outstanding students from high schools that received the Gaston Caperton Opportunity Award this year: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/academic/arroyo-valley-high-school-celebrates-power-hope&quot;&gt;Arroyo Valley High School&lt;/a&gt; in San Bernardino, CA, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://steelerslounge.com/2016/02/broome-high-school-wins-gaston-caperton-opportunity-award/595535/&quot;&gt;Gettys D. Broome High School&lt;/a&gt; in Spartanburg, SC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some of the insights they had to offer. (Quotes have been lightly edited and condensed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortes&lt;/strong&gt;: What keeps you motivated to graduate and go to college?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria Velasco, senior at Arroyo Valley High School&lt;/strong&gt;: My motivation now is definitely not wanting to let all of my teachers&#039; efforts go to waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortes&lt;/strong&gt;: Have you had to overcome any obstacles in high school?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alicia Poole, senior at Gettys D. Broome High School&lt;/strong&gt;: As an introvert, I found that my personality has hindered my learning experience a lot, because I didn’t ask questions in class andI didn’t verbally participate. I also tend to take on more than I can handle. Unfortunately, in my junior and senior years of high school, I had to drop an AP class because I could not handle the workload. At the time I did really feel like a failure, but I really realized the value of knowing what I can and can’t handle. Now I can better manage my AP classes and it has led to greater success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortes&lt;/strong&gt;: Do you feel academically prepared for college? Or, if you don’t feel prepared, what do you wish your high school or college should do more of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maddie Norton, senior at Gettys D. Broome High School&lt;/strong&gt;: I feel really prepared for college, especially because of my AP courses. I am in AP Biology, AP Calculus, AP English Literature, and AP English Language. When I go off to college, if I score well, which I believe I will, I know that I can skip the freshman courses that are required and go straight to classes that pertain to my major… I think my school would benefit if we really push AP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortes&lt;/strong&gt;: How would you describe process of finding the right college for you? What could have made it easier?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Velasco&lt;/strong&gt;: I really haven’t found the college for me yet, but I narrowed it down to USC and UCLA. I got to that point by taking a lot of factors into consideration, like average class size, location, and research opportunities. But I am really stuck between the two and so I resorted to asking my peers, teachers, and coordinators for advice. The problem was, rather than getting advice from them, I was getting an opinion, and that makes students’ decisions very difficult. I think it is important for parents, teachers, whomever to understand that just because a school might be the most prestigious in the country or the state, it’s not necessarily best for that student. There is not a right college, but there is a right college for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortes&lt;/strong&gt;: What is one piece of advice to educators in the audience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norton&lt;/strong&gt;: I always know that I have the possibility to go to one of my teachers and talk to them. Create this connection with your students — have the time, make the time to go out and just be friends, keep the student relationship. Create this friendship so they know that they are not alone, because you don’t know what is going on in their lives. That’s how you are going to get your students to go to class, to enjoy and engage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poole&lt;/strong&gt;: “Encouragement is very important because I think it is really easy for student to give up. When they are taking four, five, even six AP classes at a time, they may just want to give up. For example, at the beginning of the year, I was signed up to AP Calculus and I said no, I am not doing that, not Calculus, definitely not AP — but my teacher sat down with me and she told me scoring is not the most important thing. “If you take this class and you don’t score, I promise you will be still prepared for college,” she said. Now I am in AP Calculus, and I think I’ll definitely score thanks to the encouragement and support I got from my teacher. I think it’s important for teachers to realize students need as much support as they can get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;AP Student Panel: Lessons from Those We Teach&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

At Prepárate, attendees heard first-hand from six inspiring Latina students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students —from The Young Women’s Leadership Network &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ywln.org/college-prep&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CollegeBound Initiative&lt;/a&gt; and The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ywln.org/all-girls-school&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Young Women’s Leadership Schools&lt;/a&gt; in New York City, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sbcusd.com/index.aspx?nid=341&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Arroyo Valley High School&lt;/a&gt; in San Bernadino, CA, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rutgers.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rutgers University&lt;/a&gt; in New Brunswick, NJ —  shared their passion for STEM, praised their mentors and support systems, and asked the more than 100 educators in attendance to encourage their students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young women drew plenty of well-earned praise for their stories and successes. Several audience members were so moved that they were brought to tears, and many took to social media to share their thoughts. Here are some highlights from this powerful panel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I didn&#039;t have a Latina coder to look up to, so I want to be that for younger girls&quot; - incredible HS student. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Preparate16?src=hash&quot;&gt;#Preparate16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jennifer Rosenthal (@jenn_rosenthal) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Adults told me to do what they hadn&#039;t done... Focus on education.&quot; - Student from Spanish Harlem, found passion via teachers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Preparate16?src=hash&quot;&gt;#Preparate16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jennifer Rosenthal (@jenn_rosenthal) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As young Latinas, we need to take this step to show those coming behind us that they can achieve higher education.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/YWLN1&quot;&gt;@YWLN1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Preparate16?src=hash&quot;&gt;#Preparate16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— College Board Forums (@CB_Forums) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sin cultura, no hay libertad. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Preparate16?src=hash&quot;&gt;#Preparate16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Lorena (@MsLorenaMarquez) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latinas in education: The more educated we are, the more empowered ... Makes us free!- Diana Gonzalez &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Preparate16?src=hash&quot;&gt;#Preparate16&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;— LatinoUCollegeAccess (@LatinoUAccess)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over estimate instead of under estimate our brilliant, brave Latina/o/x students! ❤️&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Preparate16?src=hash&quot;&gt;#Preparate16&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CollegeBoard&quot;&gt;@CollegeBoard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Lorena (@MsLorenaMarquez) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As women, our voice is often silenced. Especially as Latinas we don&#039;t get empowered so we need to make sure to encourage others &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Preparate16?src=hash&quot;&gt;#Preparate16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Lorena (@MsLorenaMarquez) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You go ladies! Such an amazing group of young Latinas, champions for all women &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HispanicEd&quot;&gt;@hispaniced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Preparate16?src=hash&quot;&gt;#Preparate16&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ji0AQDKqlZ&quot;&gt;https://t.co/ji0AQDKqlZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Andrea Mozo (@AndreaCMozo) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don’t have to be me. You have to be you, and be better.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/LatinaEmpowerment?src=hash&quot;&gt;#LatinaEmpowerment&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Preparate16?src=hash&quot;&gt;#Preparate16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Terrance B. (@terranceb4)  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Young Women + Education = Power&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Students came from across the five boroughs to attend speak one-on-one with expert staff, to  to learn about new AP classes, financial aid, and fee waiver programs, to talk to college admissions officers, and to pick up free college planning materials designed to help them prepare for the next step in their academic careers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;MB.160418_01_2107.JPG&quot; src=&quot;http://myboard/News2.0/SiteAssets/Lists/Posts/AlexNewPost/MB.160418_01_2107.JPG&quot; style=&quot;height:345px; width:520px&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The session was kicked off with remarks from Carmen Fariña, chancellor of New York City schools, who spoke about new programs and initiatives like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/NYCschools/videos/10153465778164091/&quot;&gt;College Awareness Day&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/789624F3-C6F0-4A6B-96AC-0E2C91E534F4/0/MasterCalendar44.pdf&quot;&gt;Parent Academy&lt;/a&gt;, which are designed to provide help students and families better understand what to expect from the college search and application processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;MB.160418_01_2456.JPG&quot; src=&quot;http://myboard/News2.0/SiteAssets/Lists/Posts/AlexNewPost/MB.160418_01_2456.JPG&quot; style=&quot;height:347px; width:520px&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;College Board President and CEO David Coleman encouraged students and their peers to consider AP because of the positive benefits it can provide both now and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AP is a challenge that changes you,” Coleman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also asked each and every student to apply to at least four colleges and led them in a chant of “4 or more!”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;MB.160418_01_2547.JPG&quot; src=&quot;http://myboard/News2.0/SiteAssets/Lists/Posts/AlexNewPost/MB.160418_01_2547.JPG&quot; style=&quot;height:347px; width:520px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;&amp;quot;AP Para Todos&amp;quot; Community Event&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
