&lt;p&gt;“You don’t have to go to the SAT test, it comes to you now,” said &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/198-17/mayor-de-blasio-chancellor-fari-a-celebrate-first-ever-sat-school-day-of-equity-and&quot;&gt;Mayor Bill de Blasio&lt;/a&gt; to a classroom full of students. “We have a great partnership with the College Board for this effort, to make SAT more accessible to all, to really create a college-going culture, in all of our schools.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Monday&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/NYCMayor/videos/vb.22085921165/10155014978901166/?type=2&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;, Mayor de Blasio thanked Shameek Robinson, Director of K-12 for the Middle States Region, who was in attendance on behalf of the College Board.  The Mayor noted how SAT School Day is part of the College Board’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/guidance/access-to-opportunity&quot;&gt;broader efforts&lt;/a&gt; to connect students to college success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As the first person in my family to attend college, I understand how important SAT School Day can be – this is a game-changer,” said Schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña, who shared her own SAT test taking story with students. Her parents, who were immigrants from Spain, did not know what the SAT was, so it was a teacher in her school who registered Chancellor Fariña for the test only days before it was being administered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.queensvoc.org/&quot;&gt;Queens Vocational and Technical High School&lt;/a&gt; spoke about the benefits of taking the SAT during the school day.  Victoria, who is going to the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) in New York to study advertising and marketing, said she had to fill out paperwork to get a fee waiver, go to grandmother’s house to sign up for SAT because she doesn’t have a computer at home, and then take off from work to take the exam on the weekend.  “Because of the the hoops I had jump through, it became very challenging and it made it very discouraging to take the exam,” she said. Another student, Luis, who is going to SUNY Delhi to study architecture, said it was difficult to find a new school to take the exam, adding “going to a new place I haven’t discovered is even more challenging.”  New York City juniors this year will have no obstacles to taking the SAT.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://i1054.photobucket.com/albums/s490/uvasig/NYC%20SD%20tweet_zpsxzpfzhy8.png&quot; style=&quot;float:left; height:284px; width:450px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By having students take the SAT during the week at their school, students don’t have to arrange for transportation or find an unfamiliar testing site and don’t have to apply for a fee waiver since it is free for all NYC public and charter school juniors.  Also, testing no longer interferes with weekend work or family obligations and it is less stressful because students are familiar with the location and staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving the SAT during the school day fosters a college-going culture and research shows that increasing student access to the SAT results in higher four-year college-going rates.  One &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3102/0162373714521866&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; showed that, by funding SAT for all students, the state of Maine saw 4-year college-going rates rise by 10 percentage points among students who otherwise would not have taken the SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York City students will take the new SAT, which makes it easier for students to show their best work, is aligned to state standards and measures what students are learning in school.  Gone are the so-called SAT words and the penalty for guessing. Students are only tested on relevant math, and there is no separate science section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s much easier for students to prepare with free, personalized study tools from Khan Academy. There’s no need to pay for expensive test prep. Already, more than 3 million unique users have logged on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.satpractice.org/&quot;&gt;Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy&lt;/a&gt;. Data show that the practice platform is reaching students across race, ethnicities and income-levels – mirroring the percentage of SAT test takers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city will also offer the PSAT 10 to all public school sophomores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayor de Blasio, encouraged all students to take SAT no matter what they wanted to do in the future.   “It’s going to be an opportunity to take a test and change your lives for the better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;NYC Students Prepare for First Citywide SAT School Day&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK – Chancellor Fariña today announced that New York City will offer the SAT exam free of charge to all students during the school day in the spring of their high school junior year, starting in the 2016-17 school year. By expanding opportunity to all New York City high school students, the new SAT School Day initiative will address disparities among students preparing for and taking critical college access exams and builds on the success of New York City’s PSAT School Day, which began in 2007 and has led to a nearly threefold increase in the number of students taking that exam. SAT School Day is a critical part of College Access for All, a citywide initiative to ensure equity and excellence in college access and planning opportunities for all students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chancellor announced the initiative at the High School of Fashion Industries in Manhattan to kick off College Application Week, a coordinated national week-long effort focused on college planning and application activities for high school students. This year, the High School of Fashion Industries is one of 298 schools participating in College Application Week – the City’s third year in the program – nearly double the 161 schools that participated last year. High School of Fashion Industries is also participating in a pilot of the new SAT School Day.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The opportunity to go to college should never be decided by students’ backgrounds or zip codes. The new SAT School Day and the expansion of College Application Week demonstrate our commitment to providing every student with the support and resources they need to pursue college,” said &lt;strong&gt;Schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña&lt;/strong&gt;. “I only became the first person in my family to go to college because a teacher let me know it was an option and supported me through the application and enrollment process so I could follow my dreams of becoming a teacher. All across New York City, our schools must offer students the College Access for All opportunities that can help them make good decisions and reach their potential.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are thrilled to lead a whole City effort to increase college readiness and promote a strong college-going culture in every school,” said &lt;strong&gt;Deputy Chancellor Phil Weinberg&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our focus is to deliver rigorous, high-quality instruction from the moment students enter pre-K to the moment they graduate high school college-ready and with knowledge of all the opportunities that are available to them. Today’s announcement is a stepping stone on the path we are creating to increase access to postsecondary success for every single high school student through our College Access for All initiative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new SAT School Day and expanded College Application Week are part of the College Access for All initiative, announced last month in the Mayor’s plan for equity and excellence in education. Through College Access for All, every student will have the resources and supports at their high school to pursue a path to college. This can include schools providing students with opportunities to visit a college campus, get help completing applications, be paired with a college student who can serve as a mentor, or receive support in setting a strategy with their family on how they will afford college. Additionally, every middle school student will have the opportunity to visit a college campus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new SAT School Day removes a number of barriers to SAT participation for students: individually registering for the test; requesting a fee waiver; traveling to an unfamiliar location; and having to take the test on a Saturday, when students and families may have other obligations. Incorporating the SAT as a school activity also promotes a strong college-going culture, encouraging students to think about college planning and college admissions assessments throughout their high school career. Research has shown that SAT School Day broadens opportunities for all students and particularly for Hispanic and African-American students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“More New York City students will have a path to college through the SAT School Day program. Previously, only some students, no matter how talented, made it to the SAT on the weekend. Now, all students will take the SAT during the school day, which evidence shows has a deep impact on college access. Research shows SAT School Day administration has resulted in higher four-year college-going rates, particularly among first-generation college-bound students. In addition, students taking the SAT will each receive personalized practice accounts on Khan Academy and college application fee waivers if they need them. We thank the Mayor and Chancellor for extending access to SAT School Day and all the benefits that come with it,” said &lt;strong&gt;College Board President David Coleman&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I applaud Chancellor Fariña for providing the SAT exam to all students free of charge to address current disparities among many of our hardworking children and families,” said &lt;strong&gt;Public Advocate Tish James&lt;/strong&gt;. “No student should miss out on an opportunity for a better future because they are unable to afford a college entrance exam. We must continue to strive to provide our students with the best opportunities for college and careers, regardless of their socioeconomic status.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I congratulate Mayor de Blasio and Chancellor Fariña on their efforts to increase college access,” said &lt;strong&gt;Assemblywoman Catherine Nolan, Chair of the Assembly Education Committee&lt;/strong&gt;. “It is so important that New York City&#039;s students get access to the resources and opportunities they so richly deserve.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a smart, practical initiative,” said &lt;strong&gt;Manhattan Borough President Gale A. Brewer&lt;/strong&gt;. “Ensuring each and every New York City public school student has the opportunity to take the SAT is another step toward putting higher education within every student’s reach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As city officials and educators, we must do all that we can to ensure that our public school students are prepared for higher education,” said &lt;strong&gt;NYC Council Education Committee Chair Daniel Dromm&lt;/strong&gt;. “Thanks to these new reforms implemented by the NYC Department of Education in recognition of National College Application Week, students will no longer be forced to travel long distances to other schools or pay a fee in order to take the SAT, an exam that most colleges require for their application process.  I thank Schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña for removing these potential barriers, thereby encouraging more students to take the SAT by making the process easier and cost-free. I will continue to work with her to provide our young people with greater access to the academic and career opportunities they need in order to thrive after high school graduation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To facilitate the transition to the SAT School Day, the DOE piloted SAT administration during school to 6,000 students at 40 pilot schools in Spring 2015. 92 schools will participate in the pilot SAT School Day in Spring 2016 – approximately 15,000 students. These pilot years will ensure smooth implementation of the citywide SAT School Day in Spring 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the transition, the PSAT School Day – through which sophomores and juniors take the exam each October – will become part of the new SAT School Day: sophomores will now take the PSAT free of charge on the same day juniors take the SAT in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of efforts to strengthen college culture across all high school grades, the DOE will work with schools to develop college access activities for 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; graders – like college trips for 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; graders and college transition workshops for 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; graders – on SAT School Day while sophomores and juniors are taking the exam. The DOE will begin offering professional development around logistics and implementation of the SAT School Day to all high schools this spring, and will also provide support and communicate with parents and families about the initiative. The expected yearly cost of the citywide SAT School Day is $1.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of College Access for All, 298 high schools across every borough are participating in College Application Week this week – in comparison to 161 schools last year – reflecting the DOE’s increased outreach and support for College Access for All. High schools are participating in expanded and new DOE-organized citywide events like a virtual college fair and college essay workshop, and have also received support in planning school-based activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the confirmed College Application Week activities across the 298 high schools are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&quot;margin-left:10px&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Citywide virtual college fair on Thursday, Oct. 29, giving students the opportunity to have live online conversations with admission officers and students from CUNY, SUNY and over 100 higher education institutions. Students and families can register online &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.collegeweeklive.com/sign-up/new-york-city-virtual-college-fair?refcode=COU_AAOCT15_NYCFAIR&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(53, 122, 191); text-decoration: underline; margin: 5px;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;College essay workshop at John Jay College, where 80 students from across the City will receive coaching from admissions experts on crafting essays for scholarships and admissions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newark, NJ&lt;/em&gt; – Newark Public Schools (NPS) today announced an expansive partnership with the College Board to further the district’s goal of increasing the number of students who graduate from high school and pursue a college education. Through this partnership, NPS will work with the College Board to provide expanded access to the Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT®) and the SAT®, as well as a higher quality and quantity of Advanced Placement® (AP®) course work, an important consideration in college applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our partnership with the College Board is critically important to the future long-term academic success of our young men and women. It is time that we offer students in Newark the same opportunities that students across New Jersey have been afforded for a number of years,” said NPS Superintendent Christopher D. Cerf. “The College Board is partnering with us to ensure that students recognize and make the most of the opportunities available to them and realize their tremendous potential.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;District leadership worked with school leaders and educators across the district to gather feedback on the decision and to identify the programs, resources, and assessments that would provide students with the most value. Our partnership with the College Board is designed to increase access to valuable assessments and courses that play a key role in the college admission and success process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT)&lt;/strong&gt;: Beginning this fall, NPS will provide the PSAT/NMSQT to all of the district’s 10th- and 11th-grade students. The PSAT/NMSQT measures the same skills and knowledge as the SAT, so students and educators will be able to monitor progress and identify areas in need of improvement. In addition, PSAT/NMSQT results are the best predictor of a student&#039;s likelihood to succeed in certain AP courses. And, students who take the PSAT/NMSQT can access more than $180 million in expanded scholarship opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAT School Day&lt;/strong&gt;: NPS will participate in SAT School Day in April, providing the test to all 11th-graders at individual schools across the district. SAT School Day helps foster a college-going culture and increases access to college, especially among first-generation college-bound students. SAT School Day is especially beneficial for those students who may otherwise face barriers to standard Saturday administrations and would miss out on this important step in the college-going process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Official SAT Practice Through Khan Academy&lt;/strong&gt;®: All students have access to free, personalized practice through Khan Academy, a leader in online education. Official SAT Practice on khanacademy.org is helping to level the playing field for all students who are interested in taking the SAT and preparing for college. Students who take the PSAT/NMSQT and SAT benefit from these tools, which help reinforce what students are learning in classrooms and focus on the content tested, not just test-taking strategies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The PSAT/NMSQT and SAT are assessments that provide opportunities for students to qualify for financial scholarships, as well as improve their college readiness,” said Superintendent Cerf. “We will stop administering unnecessary tests, and instead focus on providing assessments that offer valuable information to help advance our students’ educational opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NPS and the College Board will also work together to increase the quality and quantity of the Advanced Placement courses offered across the district. The district will begin by offering NPS teachers access to AP Mentoring, a teacher-to-teacher professional development program, to ensure educators are successful in leading AP course work. Research shows that students who succeed in challenging course work, such as Advanced Placement, are more likely to graduate college on time, and have the potential to save time and money through placement and credit-granting policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to partner with Newark Public Schools and the entire community of Newark,” said College Board President and CEO David Coleman. “Assessment without opportunity is a thing of the past. We are committed to partnering with the Newark Public Schools to ensure that every student has access to tests that can deliver powerful benefits, including scholarships, college admission, and course credit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board will expand its acclaimed Access to Opportunity™ program to more Newark students. The College Board will provide high school course work information, college application fee waivers, and critical financial aid guidance to Newark students. Additionally, the College Board will work with community-based organizations, such as the Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club, to train them on the use of Khan Academy practice tools so students can continue their academic preparation after the normal school day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Newark Public Schools Partners with the College Board to Expand Student Access to SAT Testing and AP Course Work&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
