&lt;p&gt;The PSAT/NMSQT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, SAT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, and AP&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Exams always have been opportunity assessments, linking students to scholarships, college admission, and course credit. Anchored in the belief that students today need more opportunities — not more tests — the College Board has redesigned these exams and connected them to a wider array of educational and scholarship benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students taking the PSAT/NMSQT will have increased access to money for college through the College Board’s partnership with five of the country’s leading scholarship providers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students taking the redesigned SAT can benefit from free, personalized, interactive practice tools on KhanAcademy.org.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The AP Program has partnered with college professors and AP teachers nationwide to create new AP courses in critical STEM fields, while partnering with states to enact uniform credit policies that will help ensure that students receive the college credits they have earned through AP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PSAT/NMSQT, SAT, and AP results provide valuable information that can help ensure that more students graduate from high school ready for college and career. To support&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;decision-makers in using these results to effect change for students, the College Board has outlined three strategies to improve access and performance, bolster college graduation rates, and further increase participation in STEM course work. These strategies are part of the College Board’s ongoing commitment to connect assessments with opportunities that help more students make successful transitions to college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need fewer tests that do more,” said College Board President David Coleman. “We’re seeing great momentum through the wide and growing range of opportunities that our assessments provide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are highlights from the &lt;em&gt;2015 Program Results&lt;/em&gt; and the recommended strategies to support educators and students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Access and Participation &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding access to actionable assessments and challenging course work is an important way to connect students to college and career opportunities. Significant gains were made in access to the three College Board programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PSAT/NMSQT: Record number of test-takers. &lt;/strong&gt;In the fall of 2014, a record 3.8 million students took the PSAT/NMSQT, up from 3.7 million in 2013 and 3.6 million in 2010.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAT: Growing participation.&lt;/strong&gt; A record 1.7 million students from the class of 2015 took the SAT, compared to 1.67 million students from the graduating class of 2014 and 1.65 million in the class of 2011. A total of 25.1 percent of SAT takers in the class of 2015 took the exam using a fee waiver, compared to 23.6 percent in the class of 2014 and 21.3 percent in the class of 2011.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AP: Record number of students takes AP Exams. &lt;/strong&gt;2.5 million students took an AP Exam in 2015, compared to 2.3 million in 2014 and just under 2 million in 2011.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Performance and Success&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased access to assessments can help educators monitor student progress, understand skill areas in need of improvement, and identify students’ potential to succee in challenging course work. Results from the PSAT/NMSQT are the best predictor of a student’s potential to succeed in certain AP courses. &lt;strong&gt;In 2014-15, about 520,000 10th-grade PSAT/NMSQT takers overall showed potential to succeed in at least one AP course.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AP courses offer students the opportunity to pursue college-level course work while still in high school. Students who succeed on AP Exams are more likely than other students to graduate from college on time, and they have the potential to save time and money through placement and credit-granting policies. &lt;strong&gt;More than 1.5 million students received a score of 3 or higher on an AP Exam in 2015, compared to 1.4 million in 2014 and 1.2 million in 2011.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assessment results also can inform whether students are on track for college and career readiness.&lt;strong&gt; Nearly 766,000 (48 percent) of 11th-grade PSAT/NMSQT takers met the grade-level benchmark, indicating they are on track for college and career readiness. &lt;/strong&gt;In addition, these results can help educators and policymakers see areas of progress and growth, as well as areas for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SAT is a proven and trusted indicator of college readiness and success for students from all backgrounds. &lt;strong&gt;More than 712,000 students (41.9 percent of SAT takers in the class of 2015) met the SAT College and Career Readiness Benchmark. &lt;/strong&gt;High school graduates who reach the benchmark are more likely to enroll in a four-year college and graduate on time than those who do not meet the benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Solutions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the results, the College Board has highlighted three ways in which education leaders and policymakers can help propel students toward college and career opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage more students to think about higher education and participate in the college-going process&lt;/strong&gt;. With the support of states and districts, &lt;strong&gt;SAT School Day&lt;/strong&gt; allows juniors and seniors to take the SAT in their schools on a regular school day and avoids common complications of Saturday testing — such as part-time jobs, family responsibilities, and finding transportation. To date, all states that have made this commitment to access have seen growth in the number of students meeting the benchmark and gaining access to college.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Said Chief of Assessment Cyndie Schmeiser: “We are excited that more students are participating in SAT School Day because of all the benefits that come with it. By removing common barriers for students — like transportation or weekend work commitments — we are able to foster a college-going culture and increase access to college, especially among first-generation college-bound students. Through our assessments, we’re connecting students to opportunity with college application fee waivers and free personalized practice with Khan Academy, thereby encouraging more students to pursue a college education.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help students make the most of their college experience and graduate in four years&lt;/strong&gt;. The AP Program enlists and encourages talented teachers, provides exciting,in-depth classroom experiences, and gives students the opportunity to master challenging subject matter that often is related to their choice of a college major. &lt;strong&gt;A statewide AP college credit policy &lt;/strong&gt;helps ensure that public universities and colleges consistently and fairly recognize AP students’ academic achievements and simultaneously provides these institutions with an innovative solution to improve retention and decrease time to degree. As of August 2015, 17 states — most recently Illinois, Texas, and Virginia — have implemented unified and consistent statewide or systemwide AP policies to ensure that students’ achievements are equitably recognized.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure that more students are inspired and prepared to become the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) professionals our nation needs. &lt;/strong&gt;According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the need for jobs in science, technology, engineering, and math is expected to increase by 13 percent between 2012 and 2022 (versus 11 percent growth for all occupations). As a nation, we are not graduating nearly enough STEM majors to meet this need. Research shows that students who take AP math and science courses are more likely than non-AP students to earn degrees in physical science, engineering, and life science disciplines. To address this need, &lt;strong&gt;the AP Program has expanded its STEM offerings&lt;/strong&gt;. In 2014-15, their inaugural year, AP Physics 1 and 2 showed the largest growth of any courses in the history of AP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Senior Vice President of AP and Instruction Trevor Packer said: “We believe that inspiring and preparing students for in-demand STEM careers is an important opportunity for AP math and science courses. The launch of the AP Physics 1 and 2 courses this year attracted nearly double the number of high school students to enroll in algebra-based AP Physics classes, and demand for AP Computer Science A and our forthcoming AP Computer Science Principles is high. These results show that America’s students are eager to take on the challenge of STEM.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;A Look Forward&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the College Board announced it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;redesign&lt;/a&gt; the SAT and PSAT/NMSQT and introduce the PSAT&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; 10 and PSAT 8/9&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; to focus on the skills that recent data show matter most for success in college and career. A parallel focus on depth over breadth has been informing the redesign of AP course frameworks and exams so that teachers and students gain more time to develop the knowledge and skills required in college course work. The redesigned courses and assessments will launch on a rolling basis. Redesigned courses and exams in &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/arts-and-world-languages/art-history&quot;&gt;AP Art History&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/english-history-and-social-science/european-history&quot;&gt;AP European History&lt;/a&gt;, along with a new course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/ap-capstone/ap-research&quot;&gt;AP Capstone&lt;sup&gt;™ &lt;/sup&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt;, are in place for the 2015-16 school year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first administrations of the PSAT/NMSQT and PSAT 8/9 will take place in October 2015, and the first administrations of the PSAT 10 and SAT will be given in March 2016. Working with College Board members and partners, the redesigned assessments will connect students to more opportunities than ever before, including fee waivers for assessments and college applications, increased access to more scholarships, and free, personalized practice tools on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;KhanAcademy.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;2015 College Board Program Results Show More Students Taking Challenging Courses, Need to Improve Readiness Remains&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

That’s one of the first things he told the audience at his town hall discussion Wednesday afternoon at Forum 2015. He prefers to be honest, candid, forthright. And so, when he was asked about the subtle differences in administering the PSAT/NMSQT and the PSAT 8/9, he answered honestly: “I don’t have a command over the last-minute proctoring guidelines,” and he did not want to “dishonor” the importance of these technical questions by providing incomplete or incorrect information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, he gave out a College Board email address to which technical questions could be sent and ensured attendees that someone who did know the answers would get back to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exchange set the tone for the 75-minute discussion, in which Coleman reiterated the need for assessments to provide real opportunities for students and elaborated on the difference between “test prep” and “test practice”: “‘Catching up’ doesn’t happen in the few moments before the test,” he said, referring to last-minute cramming sessions. “The only things that really make a difference are great courses and productive practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One question from the audience about how the idea of “common standards” is misperceived by many spurred a particularly thoughtful response from Coleman: “I’m very discouraged about all of the fog around this. If you say ‘kids should have command of the founding documents and the great conversation they inspire’ — 98 percent of the population agrees.” The same, he said, held true when asking if people thought it was important for students to be able to read passages and answer questions based on evidence found in the reading. “Instead of saying ‘common standards,’ just say the specific skills,” and most people will agree. “That’s my best answer,” he said. “Get more specific.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;A Candid Discussion with David Coleman&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;John Barnhill, assistant vice president for enrollment management at Florida State University (FSU), and Jesus Jara, deputy superintendent of Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), joined the College Board’s Aaron Lemon-Strauss to discuss the new SAT, the College Board’s partnership with Khan Academy, and how they are using these tools to accelerate student readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OCPS has been giving its students the opportunity to take the PSAT/NMSQT and SAT during the school day. This past fall, the school district had a “college day” where freshmen took the PSAT 8/9, sophomores and juniors took the PSAT/NMSQT, and seniors took the SAT as a way to eliminate barriers to college for students and foster a college-going culture on campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the launch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;Official SAT Practice&lt;/a&gt; on Khan Academy, OCPS has leveraged the online learning system to promote college readiness and increase access to college. The district’s schools have opened their media centers after school and on Saturdays to allow students to practice on school computers. They’ve also worked with the local YMCA to provide opportunities for their students to practice for the SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our kids in OCPS can be ready to go and have open doors when they go into higher education and their careers,” said Jara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnhill agreed with the importance of the College Board/Khan Academy partnership, calling the tool a game changer. He added that FSU is going to begin a campaign focused on practice that will encourage prospective students to use Official SAT Practice. He believes that using Khan Academy’s practice tool will help students feel ready for college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think [Khan Academy] is going to give them hope,” he told the audience. “We’re calling it practice, but I think it is hope.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Khan Academy Gives Students Hope&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the College Board announced it would redesign the SAT to better reflect what students need to know to be ready for college, and to connect them with more and better opportunities. Now, scores for the very first administration of the new SAT — which took place in March — are available online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new online score reports give students more insight into the areas where they’re on track for college and the areas where they need to improve. To make sure students and their families get the most out of their scores, we’ve summarized below how to &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/scores/understanding-scores&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;access, understand, and use the new online reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessing New SAT Scores&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If students already have a College Board account, they can log in to &lt;a href=&quot;https://studentscores.collegeboard.org/home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;studentscores.collegeboard.org&lt;/a&gt; to see their scores. It only takes a few minutes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://account.collegeboard.org/iamweb/smartRegister?appId=301&amp;amp;DURL=https%3A%2F%2Fstudentscores.collegeboard.org%2Fviewscore&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;create a student account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding New SAT Scores&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new SAT Evidence-Based Reading and Writing section and Math section scores range from 200 to 800. Added together, they equal the SAT total score, with 1600 being the highest total score possible. The optional &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/scores/understanding-scores/essay&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SAT Essay&lt;/a&gt; is scored on a scale of 2 to 8 and is not included in the total score. &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/scores/understanding-scores/structure?ep_ch=PR&amp;amp;ep_mid=11243888&amp;amp;ep_rid=61051686&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Subscores and cross-test scores&lt;/a&gt; show how the student performed on specific skills measured in each section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;College and career readiness benchmarks:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/about/scores/benchmarks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SAT benchmark scores&lt;/a&gt; help students understand where they are on the path to college and career readiness. A color-coded message indicates whether a student is on track to be ready for college-level work in that subject area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Percentiles:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/scores/understanding-scores/interpreting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Percentiles&lt;/a&gt; let students see how their scores compare to the scores of other students. Each student will see the percentage of students in a particular grade whose scores fall at or below that student’s score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparing Old and New SAT Scores&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students who took both the old SAT and the new SAT, or who want to compare their new SAT scores to their ACT scores, can use the College Board’s online tools, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/scores/understanding-scores/sat-score-converter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SAT Score Converter&lt;/a&gt; app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using New SAT Scores&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most colleges will accept both new and old SAT scores for the next few years, and will continue to use SAT scores as they have in the past — as one factor in their admission decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All SAT takers receive &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/scores/sending-scores/how-to-send&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;four free score reports&lt;/a&gt; to send to colleges. Students can order extra reports through their College Board account for a small fee, and eligible students get &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/scores/sending-scores/fee-waivers-extra-free-reports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;four more free reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students who’ve taken the SAT more than once can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/scores/sending-scores/score-choice&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Score Choice&lt;/a&gt; to choose which scores they send to colleges. To make sure they’re complying with the admission requirements of the colleges they’re applying to, students should check each school’s official website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To strengthen their skills, students can link their online score reports with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Khan Academy&lt;/a&gt;. They’ll then receive a free, personalized practice plan, which may be particularly helpful for students who plan to take the SAT again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details on how students can &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/scores/understanding-scores&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;understand and use SAT scores&lt;/a&gt; are available online, including a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq07MvKOc1o&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;score report video &lt;/a&gt;that walks students through the benefits of the online reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;What You Need to Know About New SAT Scores&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
