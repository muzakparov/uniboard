These districts have created opportunities for students by adding new AP courses, identifying more students who are likely to succeed in AP, and offering these students extra encouragement to enroll. As participation has increased, they have also been able to maintain—and, in some cases, increase—the percentage of students who passed AP exams with a score of 3 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After State Superintendent Dr. Steven R. Staples kicked off the event and presented the awards, teachers, students, and administrators reflected on their experiences with the AP Program and explained how they were able to increase access and achievement over the last two years. Dr. Chris Quinn, director of instructional services in Stafford County, said: “Build it and they will come. We focus on increasing the number of AP courses each year. We offered 28 AP courses this year. We create a budget to send AP teachers to training and provide time for them to plan together.”  And mostly importantly, he said, “Our teachers believe our students can do it. “ Principal Greg Daniel said that at Colonial Forge High School they grew their AP Program by using the PSAT/NMSQT exam to identify all students in grades 8-11 who had the potential to succeed in advanced coursework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These efforts have opened doors for high schoolers in Virginia. “Our growing AP program has given our students a competitive edge when applying to college,” said Jessica Wilkerson, AP History and AP Psychology teacher at King George High School. “The challenging AP curriculum, coupled with our dedicated and knowledgeable AP teachers, allows students to develop skills essential to success at the college level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the panel, teachers and students had the chance to tour the Capitol building with the legislators who have helped make AP access a reality for thousands of students across the state. Delegate Steven Landes, Delegate Thomas “Tag” Greason, and Senator Emmet Hanger were recognized for their support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the day’s discussions celebrated the dedication and triumphs of those in attendance, they did not shy away from the question of how to help an even greater number of students succeed in the future. Dr. Eric Jones, superintendent of Powhatan County Public Schools, summed up the mood succinctly: “It is an honor to win an award, but our goal is to continue to serve more students successfully!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Recognizing a Commitment to AP Access in Virginia  &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

From applying to college to navigating the financial aid process to completing summer paperwork, it can be difficult for students to manage all the pieces along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange County Public Schools is making that process easier by providing a college transition counselor at each high school. At the College Board’s Southern Regional Forum, two of these counselors, Heather Alexander and Latashia Joseph, shared how their work has helped the students and parents of Orange County on their way to college, and offered advice based on the lessons they’ve learned over the past year and a half of the college transition program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicate widely:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s important to reach students where they are. Each high school has a college and career center where students can come for information and resources. In addition to in-person outreach, the college transition counselors connect with students via social media, the Edmodo global education network, school newsletters, and websites. They also use Remind, a communication tool to help teachers and counselors reach students and parents via text.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reach out to parents and families:&lt;/strong&gt; Parents are a critical part of the college planning process. Offering opportunities for parents to learn about the college application process, financial aid, and more can help them to be an active participant in the process. One of the ways that the college transition counselors reach parents is through their Parent Academy, a monthly program held on Saturdays for parents of students at all grade levels. The academy provides a comprehensive look at key components of applying to college, searching for financial aid, and transitioning to college.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide motivation and celebrate successes:&lt;/strong&gt; Completing each step on the journey to college should be recognized. One of the ways the college transition counselors motivate and celebrate their students is through “college signing days” once students have decided which college they’ll attend. Modeled after similar events for high school athletes planning to play at the college level, each school has their students sign a “letter of intent” to their future college, celebrate their college decision, and encourage their postsecondary plans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acceptance isn’t the finish line:&lt;/strong&gt; Once students have accepted an offer to attend college, their work isn’t done. Orange County Public Schools college transition counselors work to combat what is commonly referred to as “summer melt” by breaking down informational barriers for students and families, partnering with local institutions, and encouraging students to participate in summer bridge programs. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Southern Regional Forum: 4 Ways to Bridge the Gap Between High School and College&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Support from parents, school counselors, and other caring adults has kept them on track in their education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I honestly thought college was something that was out of reach to me,” Johnathan said, noting that having people motivate him has helped him reach his full potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnathan, Kharis, and Anthony all cited advanced course work as a critical part of their education that has helped them prepare for college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel academically ready for college,” said Anthony, adding that this is chiefly because of his advanced course work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a college student, Johnathan credited his AP classes with making him feel comfortable in a college classroom. “Being able to take those classes and see what a college class is really like let me challenge myself,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If more people were exposed to the kind of work and the rigor of these classes — that would get us more ready academically,” Kharis added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As high school seniors, Kharis and Anthony are excited about what’s ahead of them. However, they also know there are skills they’ll need to develop once they get to campus, like managing their autonomy as young adults on their own for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you’re in college, you have to be really responsible for yourself,” Kharis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony added: “The biggest thing I’m worried about is cleaning my room.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The students ended the plenary by offering words of advice to younger students, as well as to the educators in the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re not doing something that’s making you worried, it’s not challenging you enough. And if it’s not challenging you enough, you aren’t using your full potential,” said Johnathan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kharis closed the session by imploring educators to push every student to do more: “I think if you give every student the opportunity — honestly, I feel like they would shock you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Student Voices: Learning from Those We Teach&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The contest calls for students to submit essays that “insightfully analyze and interpret a meaningful work of art;” the winner will receive $5,000 and their essay will be published in the September 2016 issue of &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help her 27 students compose essays that were not only strong pieces of analytic writing, but also thoughtful, critical reflections on a work of art, she asked her colleague, Fine Arts instructor Chau Nguyen, to co-teach. Nguyen led students in observing Édouard Manet’s painting, “A Bar at the Folies-Bergère” (1882, oil on canvas), and coached them through a 45-minute discussion about what they noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students then selected their own works of art to analyze — from classical to contemporary paintings, to pieces of music — and went through a rigorous drafting and revising process with the help of their teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was impressed by the enthusiasm, the investment in the process,” Thornton said on St. Thomas High School’s website. “This was our first foray into merging two curriculums and we will absolutely continue next year…Promoting this ongoing conversation about culture and society just opens up another door for our students.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Atlantic &amp;amp; College Board Writing Prize Inspires Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;h2&gt;Labor of Love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by Matt Connelly, &lt;em&gt;Washington Monthly &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve hours before Paul Quinn College’s biggest day of the summer, president Michael Sorrell is meeting with his staff. There’s a lot to discuss. A fund-raiser for the school’s on-campus farm is scheduled for tomorrow, and after that, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra is playing a free outdoor concert on the lawn outside the chapel. These are two of the most high-profile events of the year for this 450-student historically black institution located off Interstate 45 in a working-class African American neighborhood of South Dallas. But Sorrell isn’t talking about any of that right now. He’s focused on how Vincent is doing at J. C. Penney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vincent Owoseni, a junior finance major from Brooklyn, is interning at the Texas-based department store chain as part of Paul Quinn’s work program, in which all students hold jobs on or off campus to help defray the cost of their education. But, Sorrell tells the room, Owoseni was having some trouble adjusting to the position—he was placed in the shipping department, which he wasn’t prepared for. Sorrell seems conflicted about the news. On the one hand, he tells his staff that Vincent needs to understand that unexpected assignments are part of any career and that he’ll learn just as much from the logistics side of J. C. Penney as from the customer-facing side. On the other hand, he treats the news as a possible warning sign. “He’s one of the best students we’ve got here,” Sorrell says. “If he’s having trouble, how is everyone else doing?” He assigns staffers to check in on other students who might be in similar situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I later catch up with Owoseni, he expresses no surprise that his name came up in the meeting. Sorrell, he says, has been in touch throughout the internship. Indeed, he’d been reaching out to him since high school. Owoseni was valedictorian at City Polytechnic High School, and Sorrell flew out to meet him. “He was very inspiring,” Owoseni says. “He asked what I wanted to do. Then he told me, ‘You can do better than that.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Better than that” is a fair description of Sorrell’s own aspirational leadership philosophy, and of the school’s trajectory since he took over as president in 2007. He arrived to find a college that was on the verge of closing its doors, buried under a mountain of debt with more than a dozen abandoned buildings and a four-year graduation rate of 1 percent. It seemed less “fixer-upper” than “lost cause.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrell went to work right away. He axed the expensive football program and turned the playing field into a farm, where students can work and from which food gets donated to the surrounding neighborhood. He traveled the country, visiting other colleges to learn from their presidents, and building up recruiting relationships with high schools. He nearly doubled the size of the student body, and raised millions from donors and corporate partners, enough to put (and keep) the school in the black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stunning turnaround of Paul Quinn has made Sorrell into a mini-celebrity. He’s been interviewed on HBO, spoken at the Aspen Ideas Festival, and participated in countless higher education panels. But what he is increasingly getting attention for is the work program, which he first rolled out in 2015. All students are required to work at least eight hours a week, first on campus for the college, then off campus for participating employers. Twenty-four hundred dollars of students’ wages per year go to offsetting their tuition, the rest goes into their pockets. This has allowed Paul Quinn to slash its total cost of attendance from $23,800 to $14,275 a year. Sorrell’s goal is to get students into the job market with less than $10,000 in debt; the average student takes on only $2,300 in loans a year after Pell Grants and other subsidies along with work tuition credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that students of modest means can contribute some of their labor in exchange for lower tuition is not new. Some Catholic high schools and a few rural liberal arts colleges have long operated that way. But Sorrell is the first to apply the model in an urban college setting. He is also the first to extend the concept beyond low-skill on-campus jobs to off-campus positions with private-sector employers, where students can garner skills and connections that might give them a leg up in the post-college job market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “New Urban College Model,” as Sorrell calls it, addresses some of the most pressing problems in higher education: how to substantially reduce tuition for lower-income, and especially minority, students in a way that colleges can afford; how to do so for students who need the high-touch support of a liberal arts college and who might otherwise get lost in a larger public university; and how to better integrate a liberal arts education with the job market. (Sorrell thinks his model can achieve even more—that reinventing the urban campus can also bring back depressed urban neighborhoods.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no wonder that Sorrell’s innovations are a hot topic in higher ed reform circles. The question is whether those interventions are, in wonk-speak, “replicable.” In other words, can other schools achieve what Paul Quinn College has without a one-in-a-million leader like Michael Sorrell?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of colleges these days, Paul Quinn offers a “summer bridge” program, in which incoming students spend six weeks getting acclimated to college life in general and to Paul Quinn in particular by living in dorms and taking a few introductory classes. Unlike at other colleges, the president of Paul Quinn teaches one. “What’s on your mind?” asks Sorrell at the beginning of one such class this past summer. Only two weeks into their pre-college experience, the assembled students aren’t afraid to share. They end up discussing the then-recent nightclub shooting in Orlando, touching on religion, gun control, and gay rights over the course of twenty minutes, leading into Sorrell’s actual lesson plan about what makes a community. The conversation isn’t purely free-form; when a student is called on, she must first stand up and announce her name loudly to the class. Any drops in volume, grammatical errors, or uses of the dreaded filler word “like” will get called out by Sorrell. “He’s intense and kinda tortures students when he’s teaching them,” says junior Elexis Evans, one of his TAs, before quickly adding, “But he’s a great professor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrell is six foot four, with an athlete’s physique, and he holds court with the confidence of someone who doesn’t mind reminding you that he was a star basketball player at Oberlin College. But even in his toughness he exudes empathy, recognizing which students he can needle and poke fun at and which ones need more positive reinforcement to get their confidence up. When the community lesson turns to crime and punishment—specifically marijuana legalization—he poses a question: “Hypothetically, how many of you have been in the vicinity of something illegal, like getting high?” About two dozen hands go up—which is about two dozen more than you’d expect from a bunch of soon-to-be college freshmen facing down the president of their Christian school. He laughs and gestures at those with their hands down. “Now, I know some of you are lying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrell says he pushes students over the summer to prepare them for college, but offers enough support that they understand it’s constructive. “You can’t allow them to not be educated, but you have to create a safe space,” he says. “I spend a lot of time affirming my students. You’re safe, I love you, I’m here with you for the long haul.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that safe space can mean the occasional questioning of the professor. When he chides a student for starting her sentence with “I feel like,” classmates protest in her defense, arguing that it’s proper usage and not a filler. Sorrell argues that it’s not incorrect but rather “substandard,” in an attempt to quell the semantic mutiny as students break out their phones to check dictionary apps and weigh in. They’re eager to prove themselves; in many cases, it’s why they were recruited to Paul Quinn in the first place. About eight in ten students are getting Pell Grants, and more than 70 percent will get no money from their families to help pay for tuition. Two-thirds of them hail from outside Texas, with high numbers coming from cities like Detroit, Chicago, and New York. Some have faced massive roadblocks in their path to college—extreme poverty, broken homes, multiple deaths in the family—and nearly all will have to work harder than they ever have before to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That includes little things like basic time management and academic skills, especially in preparation for the jobs to come. Many have never paid attention for an entire multi-hour lecture before, have never really written a paper, have nothing but anxiety at the prospect of tests that can make or break a grade. To foster a sense of professionalism, Sorrell enforces a business-casual dress code in classes. For those who don’t have the clothes, the school keeps a closet full of donated businesswear that students can borrow from. Those who struggle despite the staff’s hands-on approach can be put on the “Carrington plan”—they live together on the one dormitory’s third floor and maintain a schedule of distraction-free study hall sessions. The program is named after former undergraduate Ryan Carrington, a promising student whom Sorrell ordered to work at a desk in his own office after a massive drop in grades following a fraternity pledge. Sorrell took Carrington’s keys and cell phone and had him introduce himself to every visitor who came in. “He had never sat still long enough to learn,” Sorrell says. Sure enough, the grades went back up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrell (and the high school administrators who like to send him names) makes a point to find students like Carrington who can blossom with that extra push that Paul Quinn can provide, who have been dealt a difficult hand but have the potential to thrive in a college that’s meant to feel like a family. “There is this entrepreneurial spirit,” Evans says. “A lot of us didn’t realize we came here with that, but we had it brought out of us.” They may use “like” incorrectly at first, but they’re willing to fight for themselves when they get it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Sorrell gets the class back on track following the great “like” debate, Trezuer Butler smirks at the scene. Butler came to the summer bridge program as an incoming freshman last year, taking her first-ever flight out of her native San Francisco. Now she’s a TA at the same bridge program, her work helping offset her tuition. Like many Paul Quinn students, the urban work college model wasn’t totally new to her—she came from a work high school, Immaculate Conception Academy, where the administrators have a relationship with Sorrell. She knew she wanted to go to a historically black school, and ended up getting in everywhere she wanted to go. She picked Paul Quinn after receiving a full scholarship, and Sorrell surprised her with a call after she accepted and convinced her to come to Dallas early for the summer program. Afterward, he stopped in San Francisco for Sunday dinner with her family, who were nervous about sending her off to Texas for good. “He got permission to watch me, punish me, motivate me,” Butler said. “I didn’t have a relationship with my dad, so he really stepped in and stepped up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s remarkable about these calls and visits is how unremarkable they seem as part of his larger recruitment strategy. It’s not uncommon for Sorrell and his staff to be on a first-name basis with students who are still in high school. The school estimates that only 10 percent of incoming freshmen aren’t recruited in some way by Paul Quinn. That closeness doesn’t end when they get to campus. “I firmly believe that you meet students where they are, and you love them, and you lift them,” Sorrell says. “I believe in authentic relationships.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrell says he needs to put extra work into building trust with students because his background isn’t the same as many of theirs. He grew up upper middle class in Chicago, where his father owned a barbecue restaurant and his mother ran a social work agency, and he attended St. Ignatius College Prep, one of the best schools in the city. He got an offer to play basketball at Oberlin, but took a recruiting visit and hated it. “It really was an uncomfortable place,” he says. “People protest everything, they question everything. I wasn’t a social outlier, so I became the outlier.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, the decision wasn’t really up to him. Sorrell’s mother decided that choosing a college was too important to leave to a teenager and forged his signature on the Oberlin commitment. He was livid. That’s illegal, he told her. He could sue! “You’re gonna sue your mother for sending you to one of the best schools in the country?” she replied. “We’ll see how that goes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute never made it to court. Sorrell went off to Oberlin and, as expected, felt like a fish out of water, a Chicago jock among the hippies. But he found his place—thirty years later he’s on the cover of the latest alumni magazine and is still the basketball team’s fifth all-time leading scorer. One moment in particular from his undergrad days sticks out as a sign of things to come. A friend pulled him into a dinner with Johnnetta Cole, then president of Spelman College. He agreed because, hey, free food. But then he started talking to Cole. “She was the coolest president I’ve ever met,” he says. “I told myself, This is what college presidents can be like? Sign me up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That job wouldn’t come until much later, though. After Oberlin, Sorrell got his master’s degree in public policy from Duke. He liked it so much he stuck around for law school. But while he had always figured he would end up as a civil rights attorney, the notion seemed less and less appealing as time went on. “I began to realize the struggle was no longer in the courts,” he says. He got his JD, but set his sights on business school. Once again, Mom stepped in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She gave me the Peter Pan speech,” he says. It was time to leave academic Neverland to grow up and get a real job. (Little did she know.) So in 1994 Sorrell moved to Dallas to work for a law firm. He then spent two years in the Clinton White House working as a special assistant on the president’s race initiative. (He told the &lt;em&gt;Dallas Morning News&lt;/em&gt; that he was “way down the food chain” in the White House, but he evidently made enough of an impression that, this past summer, he was able to lure the former president to speak at Paul Quinn.) After his sojourn in Washington, he returned to Dallas, where he spent the next decade practicing law and doing public affairs consulting, including working on Dallas’s 2012 Olympic bid. Understandably, he took a special interest in sports, representing NBA players and even helping former college players heading into the NBA draft to create political-style campaigns to up their stock. His connections paid off with an offer to join a group that wanted to buy the NBA’s Memphis Grizzlies; he would have been franchise president and gotten a small ownership stake. He was driving to scout then University of Texas phenom (and future Oklahoma City defector) Kevin Durant when the people at Paul Quinn gave him a call. How would he like to be president of the college?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he’s fond of saying, when you get offered a job you didn’t apply for, that’s probably a good sign no one else wants it. Paul Quinn was on the verge of bankruptcy, of de-accreditation, of closing down for good. Why hitch yourself to that wagon when you’re about to be an NBA executive? As it turns out, there are two reasons: Michael Sorrell likes a challenge, and he wasn’t about to be an NBA executive. He agreed to take over for ninety days while the board looked for a permanent president. When the Grizzlies deal didn’t work out, he became that permanent president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even outside of the financial and enrollment struggles, things were bleak those first few years. In addition to the massive deficits and threats of de-accreditation, the campus had fifteen abandoned buildings, and the ones that were occupied were in terrible shape. Anyone could wander onto campus, and often did (faculty members were afraid to leave their purses behind them in classrooms for fear that they’d be snatched). With 140 acres of Great Trinity Forest to the north and east, the unwelcome visitors weren’t always human. Sorrell remembers driving a local politician around campus about six months into his presidency when they saw what seemed like a big dog roaming the grounds. “That’s not a dog,” Sorrell says he realized as they got a closer look. “That’s a bobcat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Sorrell reckons the bobcats were pushed out by coyotes, which have since been replaced by stray dogs. After a southern Dallas woman was killed by a pack of dogs in May, Sorrell’s summer bridge class’s big project this year was developing proposals for dealing with the neighborhood’s stray dog problem.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrell surrounded the campus with a fence and stationed security guards at the front to keep out strangers (and bobcats). Thanks to a million-dollar donation, he was able to get all fifteen abandoned buildings torn down, exorcising the campus’s most visible past demons. He began creating pipelines to bring in students who could meet his more rigorous standards. It was a pace of work that could give you a heart attack. A year and a half after he took over, that’s exactly what happened. Sorrell’s heart stopped overnight, and he was unconscious for nearly three days before coming to in the hospital. The experience only deepened his resolve. “I just remember thinking, we’re going to win,” he says. “I am a man of deep faith. And I don’t think the Lord saves you to humiliate you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrell dove into studying what other college presidents were doing. “When I started as president, I didn’t know anything,” he says. “And I hate not knowing anything. So I immersed myself in my craft.” He read and reread Loren Pope’s &lt;em&gt;Colleges That Change Lives&lt;/em&gt; and traveled the country visiting campuses, from nearby Prairie View A&amp;amp;M to far-flung Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington. His biggest breakthrough didn’t come from a college visit, though, but a high school one. On a recruiting trip to Detroit Cristo Rey, Sorrell was wowed by the Catholic school’s corporate work-study program, in which students work once a week at local businesses. It was an idea ripe for expanding on the college level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He spent the next year studying rural work schools like Berea College in Kentucky. A tuition-free institution founded by Christian abolitionists, Berea ranks number one on the&lt;em&gt;Washington Monthly&lt;/em&gt;’s 2016 liberal arts colleges and Best Bang for the Buck lists. Admirable as it is, however, only seven rural colleges run on the work model, even though the idea has been around for a century. “The reason work colleges didn’t really take hold is partly because the work is drudgery,” Sorrell says. That’s because rural areas have few local employers where students can be placed in interesting, cutting-edge jobs. “In urban areas you can absolutely connect the work to what people are studying.” It was that insight that Sorrell brought to his board and students. Getting students real professional experience while lowering tuition costs was enticing enough on all sides to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far the new model has brought vast improvements in student outcomes, Sorrell says, though it will take a few more years for the statistics to catch up. While he increased the school’s official six-year graduation rate from 1 percent for students starting in 2006 to 13 percent for those who started in 2009, the latest figure comes right on the heels of Paul Quinn’s most turbulent period, in which hundreds of students left because of the shuttering of the football team, a disciplinary and academic crackdown, and lingering accreditation concerns. (The&lt;em&gt;Washington Monthly&lt;/em&gt;’s current rankings only include an average of the graduation rates of the 2006, 2007, and 2008 cohorts.) The percentage of students who return after freshman year has since jumped from 33 percent at its low point to between 65 percent and 72 percent over the past few years, and Sorrell expects the graduation rates to follow. “The lagging indicators still measure the school that we were seven, eight, nine years ago,” he says. “We’re not that school anymore. When that graduation rate jumps, people are going to have whiplash.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrell expects that the work curriculum will only help retention. The We Over Me Farm, still Sorrell’s signature move as president, is the keystone of his model. While at first it may seem like another example of work college “drudgery,” students don’t only labor on the farm—they also work on the marketing and business sides, helping to solicit donations and make sales. While some of the produce is used in the dining halls, much of it is sold to Dallas restaurants and grocery stores along with larger corporate buyers like the Dallas Cowboys. And at least 10 percent of the produce every year is donated to charities in the school’s Highland Hills neighborhood, which sits in the middle of a food desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where Sorrell’s plan to “end urban poverty” comes in. The work college model goes hand in hand with his idea of small urban colleges as “anchor institutions”; even a small school provides economic investment, employment opportunities, and cultural resources in inner-city neighborhoods. Thanks in large part to the success of the farm, for instance, a new grocery store is opening up across the street. Paul Quinn students organized to successfully fight off a city plan to significantly expand a nearby landfill farther into Highland Hills. Students marched multiple times, wearing “I AM NOT TRASH” T-shirts, and eventually Dallas relented and threw away the landfill plan. Now Sorrell is lobbying city officials for a light-rail stop in the neighborhood, which would serve his students (who often have to take difficult bus routes or drive to their jobs around the region) as well as Highland Hills commuters. And while Paul Quinn may be gated, it can still provide an artistic as well as economic impact: in addition to lectures and symposiums that are open to the public, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra plays a free show on campus every year, which Sorrell calls his favorite event the school puts on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrell got his doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania last year using the New Urban College Model as his dissertation. In it, he argues that his model can be copied across the country. There are 1,725 four-year colleges in U.S. principal cities, and about 70 percent have fewer than 5,000 students. “This model was built to be replicated,” he says. “I’m worried about what happens if it doesn’t catch on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is, can the model catch on without such a charismatic figure leading the charge? Sorrell has an astounding ability to command the room no matter who’s in it. He can banter with students, run a staff meeting, talk with education policy wonks, chat up church leaders, and network with big donors locally and around the country. Education reform is full of examples of brave new ideas that flourished under their innovator but faltered when tried elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrell counters that there are many different types of college presidents, and that his model can work with different kinds of leaders—though there’s one quality they need. “It’s replicable, but you need a champion,” he says. “You don’t necessarily need Michael Sorrell, but you need a champion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Quinn College, of course, is lucky enough to have both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day of the farm fund-raiser and the symphony concert, Sorrell is in the library trying to figure out exactly what he wants his message to be. Paul Quinn staff and students are writing words of inspiration on their bodies and getting photographed, the results of which will be posted around campus and used in the school’s new marketing campaign. Butler, Evans, and other students are writing, erasing, and rewriting slogans and hashtags on Sorrell’s arms in a flurry of markers and baby wipes. He has always been the face of Paul Quinn, but today he’s going to have to be the biceps, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he poses for the photo, the students heckle from the sidelines. “We don’t want to be scared of our president!” Evans yells as Sorrell tries on a tough look. Later, at the concert, they’ll unsuccessfully lobby him to buy them dessert from one of the food trucks parked nearby. “We want some ice cream! Come on, do your fatherly duties!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ice cream aside, Sorrell’s fatherly duties—checking in on students before they even arrive on campus, meeting their families, looking after them on campus—may be his greatest gift to Paul Quinn. But his New Urban College Model could be his gift to the rest of the country. A system that keeps tuition low while allowing students to get real professional experience in preparation for entering the job market would be a godsend for small city schools that often struggle to do either of those. Paul Quinn College, no longer the underdog, is showing the rest of them how it’s done. Bringing the model to cities across the country and ending urban poverty might be farther down the line, but for now Sorrell still has to take it one student at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the concert, as students, staff, and community members are lining up to say goodbye to Sorrell, a boy pulls him aside. Robert, a high school sophomore who came all the way up from Houston, wants to tell him how much he likes Paul Quinn. They exchange email addresses, and Sorrell makes him promise to send him a note when he gets home. “You have it in you to do really, really well,” Sorrell tells him. “Your grades will matter. Drown out all the background noise. The lights come on, the teacher’s in front of you. Give it all you’ve got.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Members in the News: Trustee Michael Sorrell and His “Labor of Love” &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Here are some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board hosted its second annual Virginia AP Day in Richmond to recognize the achievement of five Commonwealth divisions being named to the AP District Honor Roll. Governor Terry McAuliffe presented each division with an award and met with students, including two who were invited to present to the House Education Committee. Students, teachers, and administrators also had the opportunity to discuss their AP experiences with Steven Staples, Superintendent of Public Instruction, and Holly Coy and Nathalie Molliet-Ribet, Deputy Secretaries of Education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky issued a gubernatorial proclamation declaring February 23 “AP Recognition Day.” The state’s first AP Day included legislative visits for students and teachers, acknowledgement in the House and Senate chambers, and a formal recognition ceremony hosted by the Commissioner of Education and the Deputy Secretary of Education and Workforce to honor Kentucky’s eight winning AP District Honor Roll districts. Kentucky’s Teacher of the Year, Ron Skillern—who happens to be an AP U.S. Government and Politics instructor—joined as a special guest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Texas, AP students and teachers were honored from the floors of both the House of Representatives and Senate. New York AP students were greeted at the Capitol by Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan and Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul, who encouraged students by saying, “The effort you’re putting in now in high school to obtain a college-level education is going to help you in a 1,000 different ways that you don’t know right now, including helping you save money towards college tuition later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students and educators in Austin spoke animatedly about how AP has touched their lives. A student from Katy High School remarked, “I’ve been able to explore a lot of subjects in a controlled environment, where all my teachers are there to support me. It makes me feel like I’m really prepared to go out into the real world.” Brenham High School Coach Trenton Hall discussed the importance of bringing AP Computer Science courses to his school to ensure that students earn college credit for the great work they are doing already—this year they used a 3D printer to create prosthetic hands for children in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maggie Wolf from Tomball High School in Texas was excited to participate in AP Day and see how her voice can help raise awareness around the importance of the AP program. Alexander Verdieu from the High School for Enterprise, Business, and Technology in New York City believes that taking AP Calculus will help him know what to expect when he gets to college.

From this list, three AP Districts of the Year—one for each category of district population size: small, medium, and large—were selected based on an analysis of three academic years of AP data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We look for data from districts that are casting a wide net and find students like me, like many others, who would otherwise fall through the cracks and never make it to college,” said Trevor Packer, head of the College Board’s AP program. “Over the past 3 years, 1,500 more students have joined these college level courses and Gwinnett’s scores have gone up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “We are excited that the work of our students and teachers has been recognized by College Board,” says CEO/Superintendent J. Alvin Wilbanks. “There are a lot of school districts out there, and to be named ‘District of the Year’ is quite an achievement. This is an honor that should be celebrated in every single one of our clusters, as it recognizes the hard work and achievement of students and teachers throughout the district.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AP Students, teachers, GCPS administrators, and school officials came together at Duluth High School, whose mission is “challenging all to succeed,” to recognize this momentous occasion. Duluth High School AP student Cameren Carter, who plans to attend Columbia University in New York City this fall, delivered inspirational but candid remarks about his journey with AP, which drew laughter from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everything I’m about to say is 1000% the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I’m going to take this time to tell you basically how AP has changed my life,” said Cameren Carter, who has taken 10 AP courses. “Aside from the increased college interest and knocking out some college credits, I learned a lot more about myself. I learned critical learning skills, which showed me not only how to come up with some ideas to answer difficult questions, but also how to logically connect my thoughts and evaluate the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;, rather than just the &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district will also be honored in Washington, DC, during the 2017 AP Annual Conference in July.

    <title>It Takes a Team to Open Enrollment in Advanced Placement®</title>

This is our annual time to reflect on what makes the difference. Kentucky was one of the ‘pioneer states’ selected by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nms.org/Programs/CollegeReadinessProgram.aspx&quot;&gt;National Math and Science Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (NMSI) to replicate its proven AP Teacher Training and Incentive Program. As a result,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.advancekentucky.com/&quot;&gt; AdvanceKentucky&lt;/a&gt; was created as an initiative of Kentucky Science and Technology Corporation in partnership with Kentucky Department of Education and NMSI and several other funding partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Often I’m asked “What’s the one element that has made the most difference in the extraordinary Advanced Placement (AP) gains among AdvanceKentucky schools?” They are speaking of what we affectionately call our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.advancekentucky.com/our-program/elements-of-success&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.4285; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;Wheel of Success&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; – the integrated support systems for students and their teachers proven by NMSI. The system offers an open enrollment approach to AP that is grounded in high expectations and soft landings that make it ‘safe’ for both teachers and students to try and if necessary try again. We know, after eight cohorts of participating Kentucky high schools, that adopting all of the elements of the NMSI model simultaneously is essential. The key is an inherent belief that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;many more&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; high school students can perform at AP levels.  And the AdvanceKentucky team starts each year with the collective expectation that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;many more&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; students from our participating schools, particularly those traditionally underrepresented in AP, will earn qualifying scores on the next AP exams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So far in 92 schools, with almost 700 AP math, science and English (MSE) teachers supporting some 70,000 AP MSE enrollees, we’ve seen many permutations on how this shift in open enrollment thinking can be translated into sustainable, locally relevant practices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Adopting open enrollment recruitment strategies is insufficient without a review of policies and practices.   Here are some examples of both immediate and long-term considerations – some that don’t require funding and others that might benefit from reassigning existing funds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As we shift our focus to how we can help many more students to participate in AP, do any policies inadvertently discourage students from even asking about AP – and how do we know this?  For example, do our summer assignments offer inviting preparation options or are they written in a way that ultimately discourages students from even asking about AP?  Are ‘late bloomers’ made to feel welcome in AP?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Know the profile of students that earned a ‘2’ on the most recent AP exams.  Know well what it would have taken for the majority of them to earn a qualifying score and think of these as strategic opportunities to enhance student learning – not as ‘failures’.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider creative scheduling, if possible.  For example, is it feasible to offer AP Biology for 10th graders so that access to AP math and science courses isn’t limited to junior and senior years?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look for added supports that the school could provide to students. Might we make it a priority to offer study hall for AP students throughout the day for extra help? Can we arrange extended school services for transportation for extra help before or after school? Now that we’ve broadened access, how will we help subsidize exam fees?   Are our labs equipped sufficiently for &lt;em&gt;many more&lt;/em&gt; students to ‘do’ science at the AP level?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are teacher evaluations in any way based on AP ‘pass rates’ (i.e., the number of qualifying scores earned divided by the number of AP exams taken)?  While perhaps somewhat counterintuitive, placing a ‘value’ on pass rates actually incents a ‘selective’ enrollment environment. This practice may inadvertently discourage a teacher from recruiting &lt;em&gt;many more&lt;/em&gt; students to enroll in his/her AP class and it can unconsciously dampen the level of enthusiasm for encouraging students to sit for the AP exam.  Strive relentlessly for strong pass rates but be ready for them to perhaps take a dip while simultaneously increasing the number of students receiving qualifying scores.  Over time we see instances where these rates return to baseline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set quantifiable growth goals for numbers of qualifying scores for a school and individual teachers compared to their own prior performance.  What constitutes &lt;em&gt;many more&lt;/em&gt; students in a high school of 2,000 with AP experience is vastly different than in a school of 750 or even less than 500 total students enrolled and little or no AP experience.  One size does not fit all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never stop training teachers to enhance their &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; knowledge.  Kentucky recently enjoyed access to five weeks of local APSIs, more than double the access when AdvanceKentucky began. Reach out to university partners willing to step up to respond to a growing demand for this training. For teachers who are willing to take on the open enrollment approach find them mentors who have successfully embraced open enrollment and who know well the challenges of making this shift and sustaining student success.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pay attention to the teachers of AP feeder classes and team them with AP teachers.  It’s not coincidental that almost 3,000 Kentucky MSE teachers of feeder, Pre-AP classes among our middle and high schools have received multi-year &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; training by Kentucky educators who are NMSI-endorsed national trainers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fundamental shift in approach needs thoughtful orientation and plenty of time for reflection and discussion followed by action planning and goal setting. A successful shift requires a team approach in which healthy skepticism forces the team to ask all the ‘what if’ questions and reflect on locally relevant solutions.  These are embraced only with sufficient time, which is why we begin working with interested schools almost a year in advance of formal implementation. It takes time to take a fresh, in-depth look at student data and review policies and practices that inadvertently may be discouraging AP participation – despite best intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, take seriously the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sduhsd.net/documents/Parents%20and%20Students/Special%20Programs/Access_Equity_4.10.6.1.pdf&quot;&gt;College Board Equity and Access Policy&lt;/a&gt; but figure out what this means to your local circumstances. It takes a team to open enrollment in AP and sustain high expectations for students and teachers. At the risk of oversimplifying a major policy challenge, is your goal to filter students &lt;em&gt;out of&lt;/em&gt; an AP class because they’re not ‘ready’ – or to embrace high expectations through open enrollment whereby we deliberately look for signals to&lt;em&gt; include&lt;/em&gt; students even if you know they will need support from the wheel of success?  Likewise, do your policies and practices strive for resulting in more students ‘enrolling’ in college or for more that are so well prepared with the ‘AP experience’ that &lt;em&gt;many more&lt;/em&gt; students ‘graduate’ from college with a credential?  The policy direction you take matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measuring Success                 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think this scenario is nice but not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; answer, I agree.  However, evidence suggests that it is &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt; answer for addressing college readiness and helping to close the gap among students traditionally underrepresented in AP. Please keep reading for the measurable impact that only about one-third of Kentucky’s public high schools with open enrollment have had on advancing the state’s overall AP standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the first five years after AdvanceKentucky was introduced Kentucky overall experienced a 100 percent increase in number of AP qualifying scores in all subjects and 137 percent increase in  underrepresented minority qualifying scores -- compared to US increases of 49 percent and 88 percent respectively. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The number of AP Scholars statewide increased roughly 350 percent during this same timeframe.  With dramatic acceleration in AP MSE access, participation and performance, we have seen student interest spilling over to other AP subjects and contributing to Kentucky’s overall position among the top states in qualifying score increases from 2008-2013; and 2014 results promise to be just as encouraging.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kentucky’s AP MSE qualifying scores increased 105 percent and minority qualifying scores by 180 percent.  In math-science only, minority scores increased 183 percent.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;About one-third of participating AdvanceKentucky schools is located in the rural Appalachian region, which has kept pace with 100 percent increases among these rural schools.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Among schools that have participated for a standard three-year intervention, they earned an average 229 percent increase in AP MSE qualifying scores, while qualifying scores earned by low income students increased an average 424 percent and an average 411 percent in scores earned by minority students.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the Kentucky Center for Education and Workforce Statistics released an independent research study that examined the longitudinal impact of our approach on the initial 10,500 students of AdvanceKentucky vs a control group. This study found that more AdvanceKentucky students enrolled in college and far fewer of them enrolled in college remedial classes (and there was almost negligible remediation for students earning qualifying scores). The same benefit was demonstrated among AdvanceKentucky students who were from underrepresented minority and low income populations. The study will be updated annually.&lt;/p&gt;

There are some perfectly good reasons that low-income students make those decisions (e.g., proximity to home, financial considerations), but these choices may come at a cost.  Along with our coauthor Joshua Goodman at Harvard University, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nber.org/papers/w20996&quot;&gt;our new research&lt;/a&gt; investigates one such cost – whether starting at an academically less selective college reduces the chances of attaining a bachelor’s degree. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research harnesses a “natural experiment” that stems from the Georgia State University System (GSUS) admission criteria, which allows us to compare the degree completion outcomes of two groups of students who are similar in almost every observable way &lt;em&gt;other than&lt;/em&gt; a small test score difference that pushes one group of students into GSUS colleges and the other students into less selective colleges.  We find that students – particularly low-income students – who start at a GSUS institution are 30 percentage points more likely to attain a bachelor’s degree within six years than their nearly identical peers who start at less selective colleges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For students and those advising them in their transition into college, our result drives home the importance of carefully considering college completion rates in the college search, application, and choice processes.  Importantly, our research also demonstrates to policymakers that low institutional graduation rates are not simply a byproduct of the academic preparation that students are bringing to the college table. We have identified large institution-level gaps in the degree completion rates of identical students, indicating that it does, in fact, matter a great deal where students start their postsecondary careers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Leonhardt of the New York Times looked at this research for a recent piece that focuses on the benefits of college.
