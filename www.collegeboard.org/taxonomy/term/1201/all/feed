Many think of a new school year as simply a new start or a continuation of the same.  When we look at the hard work that occurs over the summer, we really see that there is a focus on strengthening our craft and sharpening our skills to be more effective in delivering opportunities to students both now and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The College Board Midwestern team has spent a great deal of time working alongside educators in the Midwest to review data, learn new and best practices to increase student achievement as well as plan activities designed to support educators as they work with students on a daily basis.  Currently there are 26 Counselor Workshops scheduled that will support over 950 counselors in their work.  These workshops are designed to provide school counselors with the information they need to help students prepare for college and career success. These workshops will provide updates on the SAT, the PSAT/NMSQT, and AP programs. Counselors will also receive an in-depth presentation on financial aid and tips from seasoned professionals in the field.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team is excited to see that each year more and more students in the Midwest continue to gain access to advanced level courses such as Advanced Placement. Our team has spent a lot of time working at the district level helping school leaders use effective tools, such as AP Potential, to find students who exhibit potential for more challenging coursework and strategically working to provide those students those opportunities they deserve.  This work is part of our Access to Opportunity Agenda.  We are very proud of this work and partnerships with school districts in the Midwest who are focused on increasing both access and student success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we reflect on the close of a summer and the start of another school year, we are excited about the emphasis and momentum for student success in the Midwestern states that has been built through the behind the scenes work of educators in preparation of turning student dreams into real realities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Getting the School Year Off to a Strong Start in the Midwest&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

We honor the key role you play in the lives of aspiring students. We’re excited to share College Board: All Access, our newest communications tool to help better connect K-12 and Higher Ed members to the College Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our New England Regional members are among the finest seasoned and emerging leaders in secondary and post-secondary education. Together, we want to help one another learn and grow in the profession and help propel the students we serve into opportunities that they have earned. We want to extend our ongoing invitation to partner with you in your important work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fall, we have already coordinated several convenings for our members including the very successful &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/higher-ed/financial-aid/institute-financial-aid&quot;&gt;2014 Financial Aid Institute&lt;/a&gt;. The New England Team was able to reach nearly 1,400 school counselors at &lt;a href=&quot;https://counselorworkshops.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;workshops&lt;/a&gt; held throughout New England since the start of the school year. We are also hosting webinars and other informational sessions on the redesigned SAT. More information on the new SAT can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;collegereadiness.collegeboard.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the College Board released program results for the class of 2014, which shows that New England’s students are high performers on the PSAT/NMSQT, Advanced Placement, and SAT. Participation rates and SAT scores were among the highest in the nation in several New England states.  And, four out of the six New England states were above the national average in Advanced Placement in both participation and performance, a real testament to providing students access and the support they need to succeed. Your New England based-team is working with educators throughout our region by providing effective tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/start-grow-ap/grow-ap/ap-potential&quot;&gt;AP Potential&lt;/a&gt; so that students who exhibit potential for more challenging course work are identified and provided the opportunities AP courses offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the College Board, thank you for all that you do to support students so that they have the opportunity to pursue a post-secondary education. Together, we can deliver opportunity to countless students throughout our region, the country, and the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to bringing you up to date information from the New England region on All Access, and I encourage all members in the region to share their own news with College Board membership by clicking &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/all-access/submit-article&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;News from New England’s Regional Vice President and Regional Council Chair&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
