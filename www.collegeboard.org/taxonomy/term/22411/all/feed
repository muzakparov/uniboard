Similar scenarios have been playing out across the country as the College Board works to make sure that the people who are guiding our students through the college planning process have the latest, most accurate information and resources available on our redesigned assessments, financial aid, and college advising in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the workshop, a quick participant poll taken via smartphone revealed that only 44 percent of counselors in attendance felt “somewhat” or “very” comfortable talking about the changes to the redesigned SAT and PSAT/NMSQT. This prompted a discussion of the eight key changes to the SAT and how the PSAT 8/9 provides a baseline measurement of skills so teachers can monitor a student’s progress. Details on the new interactive score reporting portal were also shared as Shameek fielded questions from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than one question had to do with the costs associated with applying to college. One counselor asked if the College Board had ever considered offering fee waivers for the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE instead of for college applications – because many colleges already waive those fees.  This gave Shameek the opportunity to reveal an exciting new development: “Every student who uses an SAT fee waiver automatically gets a PROFILE fee waiver” beginning in the 2016-17 school year. The counselors responded with a hearty round of applause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked what she thought of the workshop, Margaret Ellis, a counselor at Cardinal Spellman High School in the Bronx, said, “I really enjoyed it. I feel much more informed, and I’m happy to have materials I can take back and share with my colleagues.” She also said that some of her students had already taken a redesigned SAT practice test and were particularly happy with one of the changes. “They really liked the reading passages,” she said, because they were more interesting and relevant than her students were expecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Cantor, a former teacher and counselor who now works as an administrator for New York’s Public School Athletic League, has attended the workshops for over 10 years. “I always find the information valuable,” he said. “The presenters are very good — very knowledgeable.” He then shared his favorite part about the redesigned SAT: “I think getting rid of the calculator for part of the test is excellent. I was a math teacher in the 80s and 90s, and I wouldn’t let my students bring a calculator into the classroom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of his presentation, Shameek once again administered that same poll — but the results had changed. Now, 97 percent of attendees were somewhat or very comfortable in their knowledge of the redesigned SAT. Looking relieved but not at all surprised, Shameek thanked the attendees for coming and wished them a successful school year.&lt;/p&gt;

School counselors were particularly well represented in this group that had one thing on their minds: how to help more students get into and afford college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pressure of the college admission process and the strain it can put on students’ mental health was a hot topic. “Everyone is stressed,” said Carolyn Blair, director of counseling services at Clayton High School in Missouri, but the stress “ultimately rests on the shoulders of students as they’re trying to navigate [the college admission] process.” She went on to say that a lot of students are self-medicating because of all the stress they feel to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher Watson, dean of undergraduate admission at Northwestern, said that one of his school’s goals was to support these students once they’re on campus. “They’re coming to Northwestern as stressed out as when they left [high school]. We’re adding more mental health professionals to our health offices” to help address the different needs of their students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking to the affordability of college, The Ohio State University’s Vernon Granger addressed how colleges should work to reduce the costs for students. He talked about the need for schools to be more efficient and think critically about how to lessen students’ financial burden. “How many rock climbing walls are too many?” he asked. “Two? Three? These costs are indirectly – and sometimes directly – transferred to our students.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other topics touched upon were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/financial-aid/prior-prior-year-what-it-and-why-it-s-important-start-planning&quot;&gt;FAFSA’s shift to “prior-prior year”&lt;/a&gt; and the importance of student diversity on campus. “Our focus once was on [recruiting] African American students,” said Granger. “Now we’re seeing many other ethnicities be the focus. It has changed the composition of our students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Challenges and Opportunities in Admission and Financial Aid&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Read the full statement below. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December 15, 2015&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An Open Letter to the Education Community&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As representatives of counselors, higher education administrators and state aid programs, we applaud the bipartisan support for the use of prior-prior-year income information (PPY) on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Federal data show that 2 million students already in college fail to file the FAFSA each year, as do 1 million graduating high school seniors, especially from low-income school districts. A simple goal to address this problem: make accessing federal student aid easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, the Obama Administration announced two major changes slated for the FAFSA: first, that PPY income (2015 tax year data) will be used to determine federal aid eligibility for the 2017-18 school year and second, that the 2017-18 FAFSA will be available to students on October 1, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are committed to supporting a successful transition to PPY to ensure our collective memberships understand and support the goals of PPY. Through early FAFSA, students and families will have more time to consider their aid eligibility potentially at the same time many are searching for, applying to, and even selecting colleges - ideally allowing students and families more time to consider their enrollment choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also recognize that the availability of the FAFSA in October has the potential to create significant changes in the college application and admissions process. Together, we encourage colleges and universities and all organizations who serve our students to work towards the goal of PPY to allow students more time to plan and, ultimately, to make informed enrollment decisions. Adhering to this objective, including the preservation of the May 1 decision deadline, is critical to making this important policy change a success for students and institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are committed to working closely with the U.S. Department of Education&#039;s Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) to ensure our professionals are prepared to assist students and families with this change. In the coming weeks, we will be working closely with each other and with FSA to provide information and resources to our constituent members to help answer the numerous questions pertaining to PPY implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When tiny Paul Quinn College faced its darkest hour, it turned not to a physicist or an historian or a political scientist to lead it forward. It named a corporate securities lawyer and crisis manager as its president.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The historically black college in Dallas, Texas, brought in Michael Sorrell in 2007 to turn around a school in such dire financial straits that it was on its way to losing accreditation. Eight years later, the unorthodox thinking that made Sorrell the hope of Paul Quinn’s board of trustees – and Sorrell understood that board because he had served on it – has turned the school around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trustees figured traditional leaders had brought Paul Quinn to its knees. Why not hand the reins to someone who had not spent a career in academia?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you have to go through a transformation like our school did, there are pros to bringing in someone from outside your industry,” said trustee Don Clevenger, who was appointed shortly after Sorrell was hired. “He brings more of a business attitude than would someone looking at it primarily from an educational perspective.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Financial pressures, growing public scrutiny and other problems are prompting colleges and universities to turn to new types of leaders who didn’t rise up the ranks as academics, as was the longstanding tradition. Instead, they’ve turned to politicians, lawyers, civil servants and even military officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these unconventional presidents, in turn, are bringing with them new ideas and sudden changes that have jolted the slow-moving world of higher education — often to the ire of the people who inhabit that world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Iowa in September appointed a former IBM executive, J. Bruce Harreld, a specialist in corporate turnarounds, for example. In October, the University of North Carolina system hired former Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings as president. She is scheduled to take office in March, but protesters angry over her corporate ties already&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/community/chapel-hill-news/article49198630.html&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(55, 123, 218); outline: 0px;&quot;&gt; are asking that she be fired&lt;/a&gt;. At least three schools — Mansfield University in Pennsylvania, Georgia Gwinnett College and Alabama’s Birmingham-Southern College — brought in former military officers as president, although two have since left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this recent spate of nonacademic hirings, only about one in 10 U.S. college and university presidents came directly from a nonacademic job, according to 2012 figures from the American Council on Education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That number is likely to rise, said Peter Eckel, who directs leadership programs at the University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education. The country simply hasn’t done enough to prepare academics to lead colleges and universities, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing boards looking more seriously at a range of candidates,” Eckel said. “That’s partly because the pipeline is not real robust right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, new ways of thinking can reinvigorate a stagnant or troubled campus, as Sorrell did at Paul Quinn. On the other hand, those campuses can be powder kegs of self-interested constituencies, and outsiders sometimes encounter suspicion and outright hostility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take Harreld, whose hiring at Iowa was criticized immediately by faculty members who voiced concern that he did not understand higher education. The American Association of University Professors in December released a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/IowaInvestigation.pdf&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(55, 123, 218); outline: 0px;&quot;&gt;scathing report&lt;/a&gt; contending Harreld had been hired despite faculty concerns that he was dramatically unqualified for the role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience illustrates the tricky balancing act characterizing college presidencies. Presidents must appease the trustees who hired them by attracting donations and academic notoriety, but also must inspire confidence among employees wary of dramatic changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite coming to Paul Quinn with the intent to transform the school, Sorrell has managed to avoid major missteps. Concerned by the college’s tattered finances and falling enrollment, Sorrell disbanded the football team and turned the field into a farm in an attempt to turn around the “food desert” of Paul Quinn’s poverty-stricken surroundings, with students leading the farming, business plans and marketing. He hopes to turn the school into a model for how institutions can bring healthy food to poor neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The college, once down to its last few dollars after a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/archive/usao/txn/PressRel08/fantroy_sen_pr.html&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(55, 123, 218); outline: 0px;&quot;&gt;trustee embezzled thousands&lt;/a&gt; from the school, has bounced back with large annual budget surpluses. And Sorrell, dismayed after his arrival by the pajamas and sweats worn by students, instituted a business casual dress code on campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, Sorrell announced a slew of other changes, including the addition of several new majors, cheaper textbooks and a “work college” model that will discount tuition for students who work on campus for two years and then at a participating company for the final two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of students at the Christian college has since rebounded, to 425, after plummetting from 550 in 2007 to about 150 in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A supportive board and staff is essential for innovation, Sorrell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It would have been really easy for them to be skittish,” said Sorrell, who said he decided as an Oberlin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College undergraduate that he wanted to be a college president (although he also counts cabinet secretary and NBA team owner among his goals). “We proposed some pretty outlandish things. The farm was one of those things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was pretty clear upon Sorrell’s arrival that faculty members were worried about the changes to come, said Clevenger, the Paul Quinn trustee. After all, this was a guy who had spent the past few years doing crisis management for NBA players, not roaming a college campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think early on they spoke different languages,” Clevenger said. “There was friction, as you might imagine. As he’s remade the school, that has been ironed over.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although skepticism about outsiders continues, there are some success stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of California, for example, struggled under state budget cuts when it brought in Janet Napolitano, a former Department of Homeland Security secretary and Arizona governor, in 2013 to lead the 10-campus system. Her political savvy as she butted heads with Gov. Jerry Brown has led to the restoration of some state money after years of budget cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, named president of Purdue in 2013, has mostly managed to avoid controversy even as he’s trimmed costs and pushed a new kind of financial-aid tool called income-share agreements that could replace loans for some students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presidents from academic backgrounds are innovating, too, said Eckel and other education experts, and trying new strategies to attract students and donors during a particularly tumultuous time in higher education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Northern Arizona University and the University of Maine at Presque Isle, for example, seasoned administrators Rita Cheng and Linda Schott, respectively, have been willing to push the boundaries of competency-based education, which allows older students to use life experience to earn degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re at a turning point,” Eckel said. “There’s a lot of presidents who are saying, ‘This is the time to try new things.’ “Good boards are going to be supportive of innovation and allow presidents to take risks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risks are the only way to fend off arguments about such things as high college costs and low success rates, Sorrell said, and sometimes an outsider is the best person to take them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know what’s not possible,” he said. “If I had come from higher education, I might have looked at Paul Quinn College and said, ‘This is impossible.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said: “It’s not that I’m amazing. It’s just that no one else took the job.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>College Board Announces Major Expansion in Access to Scholarships for the Millions of Students Who Take the PSAT/NMSQT®</title>

The American Indian Graduate Center and American Indian Graduate Center Scholars (AIGC and AIGCS), Asian &amp;amp; Pacific Islander American Scholarship Fund (APIASF), Hispanic Scholarship Fund (HSF), Jack Kent Cooke Foundation (JKCF), and the United Negro College&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fund (UNCF) will use information from the PSAT/NMSQT&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to expand access to nearly $180 million in existing scholarship dollars to low-income and minority students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PSAT/NMSQT information will allow AIGC and AIGCS, APIASF, HSF, the JKCF, and UNCF to reach a better representation of high school students across the country who may not have otherwise been aware they were eligible for scholarship opportunities. Outreach will begin with students from the class of 2015 who have taken the PSAT/NMSQT during high school and opted in to receive materials from scholarship providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PSAT/NMSQT is the nation’s largest and most representative precollege assessment. In October 2014, a record 3.8 million students took the exam. As a result of the College Board’s ongoing efforts to expand access to the PSAT/NMSQT to a broader group of students, 77 percent (897,567) of minority students who graduated from public high schools in 2014 took the PSAT/NMSQT at least once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement reinforces the College Board’s commitment to making assessments a platform for delivering opportunity. These new partnerships, combined with the College Board’s long-standing partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalmerit.org/&quot;&gt;National Merit Scholarship Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (NMSC), create a portfolio of opportunities that reach every major segment of students. The scholarships will now range from programs focused purely on academic merit, to those available to students who meet specific financial, racial, ethnic, and other eligibility requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What this country needs is not more tests but more opportunities,” said David Coleman, president and CEO of the College Board. “The 3.8 million students who already take the PSAT/NMSQT will now gain access to nearly $180 million more in scholarships, early enough in their high school careers to change their futures. These partnerships complement our work with National Merit Scholarship Corporation, and further remove barriers to college and career success for students across the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the College Board launched a redesign of the PSAT/NMSQT. Like the redesigned SAT, the redesigned PSAT/NMSQT will be focused on the skills and knowledge evidence shows is necessary for success in college and career. The first administration of the exam will take place in October 2015.  In addition to scholarship opportunities, additional benefits of the current and redesigned PSAT/NMSQT include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Practice for the SAT;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A mid-high school check on whether a student is on target for college and career readiness;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detailed performance feedback and suggestions for how students can improve their readiness for college and career, including free, personalized SAT practice through Khan Academy;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Access to challenging course work by identifying students’ potential to succeed in Advanced Placement courses; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Access to free college and career planning resources such as Student Search Service®, My College QuickStart™, and BigFuture™.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Statements from the New Partners&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P. “Sam” Deloria, Director, AIGC&lt;/strong&gt;: “Since our founding, AIGC and AIGCS have been driven by a commitment to expand the number of American Indians  who earn professional degrees. We recognize how critical financial support is to ensuring students can pursue postsecondary opportunities, and working with the College Board allows us to reach a broader group of American Indian students who can take advantage of the scholarships we offer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neil Horikoshi, President and Executive Director, APIASF&lt;/strong&gt;: “Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) students are often left out of the conversation when it comes to intervention for college access and success. We are thankful for partners like the College Board, who recognize the need and are helping us inform AAPI students about resources they have to pursue a college education.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fidel A. Vargas, President and CEO, HSF&lt;/strong&gt;: “Our goal is to provide students all the tools they need to apply to college, do well in their course work, graduate, enter a profession, excel, help lead our nation going forward, and mentor the generations to come. Working with the College Board is yet another way we will be able to further our goals and help Latino students make successful transitions to college.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harold O. Levy, Executive Director, JKCF: &lt;/strong&gt;“The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation awards annual scholarships of up to $40,000 to high-performing students with financial need. By partnering with the College Board, we are able to engage a broader universe of high-achieving, low-income students that have the ability to excel when given the resources to develop their talents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael L. Lomax, President and CEO, UNCF&lt;/strong&gt;: “For 70 years, UNCF has worked to help students get to and through college. Partnering with the College Board will allow us to further expand our reach to African American students across the country who will benefit from being able to access the scholarships and resources we are prepared to provide.”&lt;/p&gt;

These resources, and more to come from RMU, are a good example of the growing number of supportive voices students can turn to as they navigate their path through college.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will Owen take advantage of the resources on campus to ensure his loans are manageable after college? Or, will he risk his academic scholarships to go swimming with a duck? Find out below!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KJwmT1sNpY&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creation of the RMU College Affordability Academy™, a training opportunity for staff and faculty across the university on topics such as how families are challenged to finance higher education, how RMU’s investment in students is evaluated by third parties and perceived by the public, and how the benefits of an early connection with the career center can lead to lifetime employability, was developed when the university was implementing its most recent five-year strategic plan.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sharing this idea with industry leaders and receiving their feedback, eight modules were created and 50 staff and faculty from admissions, financial aid, student financial services, women’s leadership, online student services, career center, academic services, and many other colleagues met for 90 minutes every two weeks to discuss financial literacy and career planning in a higher education context. We discussed current articles, had lively discussions and shared concern about how families are not armed with sufficient information to make informed decisions about net price, debt, and expected income after graduation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal was to inform members of the RMU community who interact regularly with current and potential students and families. We want to be a force for good decision-making as this topic is a daily headline. To solidify what our colleagues were learning, we incorporated a capstone project. Teams were cross-functional and developed a “deliverable” that would translate what was learned in the Academy ™ to current and potential students and parents. The video is one of the capstone projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working with several state-wide organizations and foundations to broaden our reach with this innovative initiative. And more videos will be coming in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;
