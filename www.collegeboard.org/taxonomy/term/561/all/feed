&lt;p&gt;As part of our Access to Opportunity&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; program, the goal of All In is to enroll 100 percent of students who have demonstrated that they are likely to succeed in AP in at least one AP course.  Since December, we’ve reached out to parents, teachers, counselors, principals, and the students themselves to encourage those students to take at least one AP class next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, All In sent a letter to parents with a checklist of easy steps to help enroll their children in AP. In that letter, we asked parents to respond and let us know if they were interested in expanding AP opportunities not only for their children but for other African American, Latino, and Native American students in their communities. The response was heartening. Almost 1,000 parents indicated that they wanted to become involved in the work of the All In campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also reached parents by partnering with the Michele Stephenson and Joe Brewster, the filmmakers responsible for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/pov/americanpromise/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Promise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; documentary, by creating informational packets on African American male participation in AP. These packets were distributed at parties organized around the PBS airing of the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We contacted superintendents, principals, teachers, and counselors, asking them to be proactive in reaching out to students likely to succeed in AP to encourage them to take AP classes, and the reaction of these education professionals was also strong. The College Board’s Social Justice in-box was flooded with amazing stories about how these practitioners were able to dramatically increase AP enrollment among African American, Latino, and Native American students in their schools and districts. The overwhelming professional response prompted us to plan a webinar in April where educators shared their best All In practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have involved students not only through parents and school staff but also through our targeted social media and email campaigns. We were able to leverage the star power of Shonda Rhimes, creator of &lt;em&gt;Scandal &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Grey’s Anatomy, &lt;/em&gt;Richard Sherman of the Seattle Seahawks, and David Johns, executive director of the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans, who shared their AP experiences. All In’s targeted social media efforts on Twitter, Facebook, and Pandora brought over 10,000 visitors to our website. Students heard over and over again — from sources they trust — that they have not only the potential to succeed in AP classes but also the support of parents, teachers, counselors, and administrators to thrive in those classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, we were able to call a sample of the parents and students to whom we reached out via snail mail and email. The responses were encouraging. For example, of those contacted, 89 percent of the parents and 84 percent of the students were aware of the students’ AP potential. Eighty-six percent of the students and 81 percent of the parents said that they had already taken or would take the steps needed for AP class enrollment in the 2014-15 school year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a long way to go, and we look forward to continue moving the needle for high-performing African American, Latino, and Native American students.

    <title>Going ‘All In’ for Our Nation’s Students of Color</title>
    <link>https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/academic/going-all-our-nation-s-students-color</link>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the last 10 years, the College Board’s Advanced Placement expansion efforts have nearly doubled the number of students who have been given access to the opportunities AP repeatedly proves to offer, including greater college preparedness and potential cost and time-savings through credit-granting policies. We are especially proud that low-income students have made up a significant part of that growth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we still have a long way to go. The PSAT/NMSQT® is currently the best indicator of a student’s potential to succeed in certain AP courses. But last year alone there were nearly 300,000 students with this potential who didn’t take an AP course for which they were qualified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap between earning the opportunity and seizing it is most pronounced among traditionally underserved minority populations. For example, only 3 out of 10 African-American students with high potential for success in AP science course work take an AP science course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One essential approach is to continue to bring AP into schools with these academically prepared and motivated students, particularly those with large minority and low-income student populations. To that end, we have developed partnerships with the Michael &amp;amp; Susan Dell Foundation to launch &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/initiatives/ap-opportunity-program&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(255, 120, 0);&quot;&gt;150 new AP courses &lt;/a&gt;reaching more than 9,000 low-income students in the next three years, and with Google and DonorsChoose.org to create 500 new &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/initiatives/ap-stem-access-program&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(255, 120, 0);&quot;&gt;AP STEM&lt;/a&gt; courses in public schools and enable more women and minorities to excel in science and math. The latter project enabled 10,000 students who did not previously have access to AP courses to take AP exams this past May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ironically, our greatest challenge may be to get more qualified students into AP classes in schools where AP already exists. A shocking two-thirds of students with AP potential who do not take AP classes attend schools that do in fact offer AP in their curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons are complex and manifold, but one thing is clear. According to public opinion research, the most powerful factor that turns a potential AP student into a registered AP student is the spirited encouragement and enthusiastic support of a teacher, counselor, or school administrator. In other words, adults who work in schools have enormous influence and can, by reaching out to a student with AP potential and encouraging her or him to take AP classes, quite literally change the education trajectory of that student. In schools with high percentages of underrepresented students, the cumulative impact can be incalculable. That’s why we started “&lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/k-12/all-in&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(255, 120, 0);&quot;&gt;All In&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All In is a College Board campaign that aims to unite educators, administrators, communities, and students themselves in an effort to ensure that every African-American, Latino, and Native American student with AP potential enrolls in at least one AP class and that every ounce of talent is given the chance to blossom instead of wither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In creating All In, we have been inspired by the hundreds of schools and districts that have already made enormous progress by supporting teacher professional development, removing financial barriers, aligning curriculum and instruction, and so much more. And we honor those that have made a concerted effort to identify and recruit students with AP potential, like last year’s Advanced Placement Large District of the Year winner, Texas’s North East Independent School District. Sheila Richards, one of its AP English teachers, describes the overall approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of our goals is to find students who might not otherwise participate in the program and to bring them in and assure them that we, the adults, are there to help them. We’re the support system and we’re going to use all the tools in the toolbox to make sure that they find success; (we tell the students) yes, it’s difficult, and, yes, you’ll be challenged, but we’re going to be there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invite you to be there for students as well by visiting our &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/k-12/all-in&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(255, 120, 0);&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, joining the All In campaign, and helping us get &lt;em&gt;every single qualified student&lt;/em&gt; into those AP classrooms. We want all in. No exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want all in because we believe that access to opportunity is as inalienable a right as the pursuit of happiness. And for a large portion of our nation’s youth, AP is what gives them a running start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s what led West Leyden High School Class of ’14 graduate Julius Figueroa to speak on a distinguished White House panel last week to discuss how AP paved the way for his acceptance to Columbia University this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s what inspired Derrick Simmons, who just graduated from Howard University, to go on to pursue a graduate teaching degree at American University while teaching math to low-income minority students in a Washington, D.C., high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s what has made—and continues to make—opportunity and success realities for countless thousands of students. But until these realities are in the vision and reach of every student—regardless of race, background, or family income—our satisfaction with what we have accomplished must be tempered by our obligation to do more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We share that obligation with the educators, counselors, and administrators at the literal doorsteps of our nation’s youth. We hope that, by joining All In, you will open those doors with the materials, knowledge, and strategies that will help every one of your students step confidently into the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Going ‘All In’ for Our Nation’s Students of Color&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
