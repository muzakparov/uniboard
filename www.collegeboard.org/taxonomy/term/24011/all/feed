&lt;p&gt;From the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NICOLE HURD, College Advising Corps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;The national average ratio of guidance counselors to public high school students is 1 to 471; in California, it’s 1 to 1,000. Compounding the issue, counselors in modest and poor districts are evaluated based on whether their students finish high school, not whether they apply to and succeed in college. And, of course, wealthy districts have more advisers than poor ones, which means that the kids who could use the most help are getting the least. Hurd founded the College Advising Corps to address the problem. A national service organization, the CAC recruits recent college graduates and deploys them to high schools with high numbers of low-income students. Think Teach for America, but for counseling—and with some important differences. CAC advisers overwhelmingly resemble the students they help: 66 percent are underrepresented minorities, 62 percent were eligible for Pell Grants in college, and 54 percent were the first in their families to go to college. They’re not taking anyone’s job: they’re on the payroll of the university they graduated from, with their salaries coming half from the university and half from a mix of philanthropic and public sources. The goal is to work with teachers, counselors, and principals to create a culture in which kids expect to go to college. Hurd recalls getting a call from a principal gushing about a CAC adviser. The adviser had found that many of her students refused to engage with the admissions process because they didn’t know anyone who’d ever gone to college. So she convinced the school’s teachers to put signs on their classroom doors showing not only their name, but also their alma mater—a small but meaningful way to make students realize that they were surrounded by people who had gone to college. The CAC can point to more concrete results, too. Over the past two years, college enrollment rates in its New York City partner schools have gone up by 35 percent. But Hurd knows the organization can’t single-handedly solve the college-advising crisis. “That’s not going to happen without public investment,” she says. “Part of our goal is to execute with excellence and keep proving to everybody that this works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAN PORTERFIELD, Franklin &amp;amp; Marshall College&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;Can a selective liberal arts college triple its share of low-income students in a few years without sacrificing academic quality? The example of Franklin &amp;amp; Marshall suggests that the answer is yes. Since Porterfield became president in 2011, Pell-eligible students have gone from 5 percent of the student body to 19 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;That’s one result of the ambitious Next Generation Initiative, a multipronged effort to boost Franklin &amp;amp; Marshall’s socioeconomic, racial, and geographic diversity. The college has eliminated so-called merit aid, which overwhelmingly goes to students who can afford tuition, and doubled its spending on need-based aid. It hosts a three-week summer prep program for high-achieving, low-income high school seniors from urban charter networks and rural Pennsylvania schools. And each year the school accepts two ten-student cohorts from the Posse Foundation, a nonprofit focused on college access. Porterfield is especially proud that these students are actually improving the academic environment. First-generation students and Pell Grant recipients have the same average grades as the overall student body, and students who get need-based aid are graduating at a higher rate, with higher GPAs, than the school as a whole. The college says it has gotten more selective, not less, since it started the initiative. To Porterfield, that makes it an obvious win-win. “I wish I could tell you that I was facing competition from ten other top schools,” he says. “But the reality is, these students are under-recruited.” Once on campus, they raise the bar for everyone. “Education is one endeavor where everybody wins if you give low-income kids an opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

In a conversation at the College Board’s Forum, Hurd, alongside College Board President and CEO David Coleman and Congressman Joaquin Castro, discussed how to partner with school counselors to help every student succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hurd started College Advising Corps to build upon the great work school counselors do every day to advance students along the opportunity pathway. They place well-trained, recent college graduates as full-time college advisers in high schools across the country. Making sure students reach the critical milestones research shows will get them to successfully matriculate is a priority for the organization. Activities like applying to 3-5 match colleges and completing the FAFSA have become key metrics that College Advising Corps uses to evaluate their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s about personalized, thoughtful advising that gets students to a place where they are going to succeed,” Hurd said. “How can we hold a young person’s hand and pull them through that door of opportunity?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Castro, who has supported school counselors through his policy work and public service, cited the importance of an infrastructure that guides students to college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are important things that happen inside the school, but outside the classroom,” Castro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked how Forum audience members could help support school counselors and get more of their students to college, Hurd in turn posed a question: Are we saying yes enough? She challenged attendees to say yes to those who come to us asking for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To close out the plenary, Coleman announced that the College Board and College Advising Corps will bestow an annual award to a school counselor who “blows us away” with their dedication and commitment to the students in their care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myliss Parker, Director of Advanced Academics at Los Fresnos Consolidated Independent School District in Texas, was the first recipient of this honor. A fierce advocate for getting her students into higher education, she has focused much of her work on addressing summer melt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m extremely humbled by this honor,” Parker said. “God has blessed me to work with wonderful, wonderful students, but even more the young people that have been sent to my district [through College Advising Corps].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Are We Saying Yes Enough?

&lt;p&gt;Today, we build on that momentum with more news: &lt;strong&gt;The College Board and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) are launching a two-year partnership that will help millions of students better prepare for college and career. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we look at students in America, we see incredible talent, but there are too many barriers in the way,” said College Board President David Coleman. “The College Board and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative are united in our belief that if we clear a path for all students, they won’t just walk down it, they’ll run.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board will dramatically expand access to unique, personalized learning pathways—including PSAT-related assessments, interactive SAT practice, and Advanced Placement courses—all of which help prepare and propel students forward and identify a postsecondary program that best fits their needs and passions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Said Jim Shelton, president of education for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative: “The work being done by the College Board to help students tailor their SAT practice and prepare for college is a promising approach to scaling personalized learning. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is proud to support the College Board in its effort to reach more students across the country and fundamentally improve the access, experience, and preparation they make available to each student.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE WORK AHEAD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership will enable the College Board to bring to scale successful initiatives, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introducing more students &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which provides free, world-class and personalized online study tools for all students to prepare for the SAT. Newly released data link Official SAT Practice to substantial score gains from the PSAT/NMSQT to the SAT. Research confirmed that practice on Khan Academy advanced students regardless of gender, race, income, and high school GPA. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Connecting more students to near-peer advisers through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://advisingcorps.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;College Advising Corps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (CAC). CAC advisers are recent college graduates, many the first in their family to attend college, who serve full time in underrepresented high schools across the United States, providing personalized advice to high school students about navigating the path to college.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Helping to bring &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/stem/computer-science-principles&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AP Computer Science Principles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (AP CSP) to every school district in the country, with a special focus on rural communities. The course, which launched in 2016, is transforming the way that students, especially underrepresented and female students, begin studying STEM subjects. AP CSP goes beyond coding, introducing students to the foundational concepts of computer science and challenging them to explore how technology can impact the world, with a focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a special focus on students in lower-income communities and rural areas, the College Board will also collaborate with other organizations who work closely with students and educators, including the Council of the Great City Schools, the National Rural Education Association, TNTP, Character Lab, and Stanford University, and districts and states across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
