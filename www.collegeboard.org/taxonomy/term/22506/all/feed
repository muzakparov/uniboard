New developments such as the expanded scholarship opportunities through the PSAT/NMSQT®, the College Readiness and Success System and the Assessment Redesign, and our Access to Opportunity&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; initiatives provide the foundation for this work. There is one place at the College Board that has had its feet on the ground and has been working to deliver opportunity directly to students in the Washington, D.C., area for over 47 years: the Educational Opportunity Center (EOC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Educational Opportunity Center is one of a set of eight educational opportunity outreach programs federally funded by the U.S. Department of Education — collectively &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/trio/index.html&quot;&gt;called TRiO programs&lt;/a&gt; — that help low-income, first-generation students pursue educational opportunities. Originally founded in 1967 as an Educational Talent Search program by local college admission officials, financial aid representatives, and staff from the College Board’s Washington Office, the EOC is one of 120 such centers throughout the country focused on enhancing the college and career prospects of disadvantaged individuals by connecting them with academic and financial information that can help them reach their full potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the District of Columbia, a dedicated and experienced staff of six counselors serves over 3,000 first-generation potential college students, low-income adults, and displaced workers annually, providing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assistance with applications for admission and financial aid&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information on financial aid resources and scholarships available to pay for college or vocational training&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;College and career counseling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Financial and economic literacy workshops&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GED practice testing and registration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adult-learner and college survival skill workshops&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;EOC counselors take an active role in serving D.C. residents and spend considerable time reaching out to and working with students and adult learners who have expressed a desire for postsecondary education that can help them meet their personal and professional goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EOC is directly connected to the College Board’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/guidance/access-to-opportunity&quot;&gt;Access to Opportunity&lt;/a&gt; initiative, which seeks to identify and break down barriers that often keep students — particularly students from underserved backgrounds — from applying to and enrolling in college. From launching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/k-12/all-in&quot;&gt;All In campaign&lt;/a&gt; to encourage students of color who are likely to succeed in at least one AP course, to easing the financial burden of applying to college by providing college application fee waivers, the College Board is dedicated to connecting all students to college success and opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Access will continue to feature the work of the EOC and its alignment with the Access to Opportunity initiative in the coming months. Please contact Jerome Jackson by email at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:jjackson@collegeboard.org&quot;&gt;jjackson@collegeboard.org&lt;/a&gt; or by phone at 202-741-4730 for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College Board&amp;#039;s Educational Opportunity Center Serves Adult Learners in D.C.&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
