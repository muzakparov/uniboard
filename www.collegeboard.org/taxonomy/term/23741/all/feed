&lt;p&gt;This winter, we’re celebrating two AP teachers who have been recognized for their commitment to their craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, AP teacher Kenneth H. Keller was appointed to the Board of Directors for the National Council for Geographic Education (NCGE). Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ncge.org/files/documents/2016-NCGE-Board-of-Directors.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;official announcement&lt;/a&gt; from NCGE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;The National Council for Geographic Education (NCGE), the national non-profit association for geography education in the United States, announced the appointment of three new members to its Board of Directors, as well as the full slate of Board Members for 2016. Joining the Board of Directors are Mr. Kenneth H. Keller, Dr. Jeff Lash and Mr. Charles Regan. ‘These appointments reflect NCGE’s commitment to finding the very best individuals to lead and guide the geography education community,’ said Zachary R. Dulli, Chief Executive Officer, ‘Their knowledge, skill, and expertise will be invaluable to NCGE as we begin to shape our organization’s next 100 years.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;Kenneth H. Keller is an instructor of Advanced Placement (AP) Human Geography and AP European History at George Walton Comprehensive High School in Marietta, GA. He has taught AP Human Geography since its inception in 2000-2001. Ken is a past member of the AP Human Geography Test Development Committee (2006-2010) and the National Council for Geographic Education’s Executive Planning Board. He is currently a table leader at the APHG scoring/reading in Cincinnati, OH and has been a question leader from 2012-2014. He has also attended the reading and worked in other roles since June 2002. Ken has been teaching AP Human Geography weeklong summer institutes and one day workshops for teachers since 2004. He is also a 2004 recipient of a NCGE Distinguished Teaching Award. Ken is a Past-President of the Connecticut Council of Social Studies. He also taught as an adjunct professor of Geography for five years at Western Connecticut State University. Ken took on other various positions related to geography education during his time teaching at Danbury HS, Danbury, CT before relocating to Georgia in August, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, AP Calculus teacher Anthony Yom and his student, Cedrick Argueta, have  been celebrated by the LA School Board, profiled by dozens of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-calculus-wiz-20160127-story.html&quot;&gt;news &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://laschoolreport.com/how-this-math-teacher-helps-kids-get-perfect-scores/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;outlets&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/POTUS44/status/693841529169952768&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tweeted &lt;/a&gt;at by President Barack Obama. Argueta was one of 12 students worldwide to receive a perfect score on the AP Calculus exam last year, and all of Yom’s students have passed the exam for the last three years. NPR&#039;s David Greene interviewed Yom for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2016/02/09/466108287/just-an-average-guy-excels-at-teaching-students-ap-calculus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Morning Edition&lt;/a&gt; this February. Here is an excerpt from their conversation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;GREENE: It sounds like you really love your students and care about their success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;YOM: Definitely. I mean, isn&#039;t that what teachers are supposed to do? I get that question a lot of the times, but, I mean, that&#039;s why I chose this job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;…Sometimes I feel really guilty because I feel like I&#039;m taking recognition from all these great teachers around the nation. And I just wanted the listeners to know that I&#039;m just an average guy. But I became who I am because I had great teachers. And we if we could start recognizing good teachers and give them a little more energy, I think we could definitely change the game in the education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to the full interview on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2016/02/09/466108287/just-an-average-guy-excels-at-teaching-students-ap-calculus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;AP Teachers in the Spotlight&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
