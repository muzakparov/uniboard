&lt;p&gt;The College Board’s new AP Computer Science Principles course played a prominent role in this announcement. The new multidisciplinary computer science course was designed with support from NSF to help recruit more students, including females and underrepresented minorities, into computing. The new course will be taught in secondary schools starting in the 2016-17 academic year with the first exam administered in May 2017, and  will draw more students into the discipline by focusing on foundational computing skills and the creative aspects of computing. The inherently multidisciplinary course teaches students to analyze problems, create computer programs, and collaborate to find solutions to real-world issues.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://csedweek.org/&quot;&gt;Computer Science Education Week&lt;/a&gt; (CS Ed Week) was inaugurated by Congress in 2009 to honor the life and achievements of Grace Hopper - computer pioneer, Navy rear admiral and inventor of one of the first computer programming languages. The celebration encourages individuals of all ages to learn more about computer science and its important role in our increasingly digital and computational world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;New AP Computer Science Principles Course Prominent in Computer Science Education Week&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;h2&gt;AP Computer Science Principles Course Aims to Attract More Students to the Field&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The College Board&#039;s new offering focuses on expanding access as more jobs require computing knowledge.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;San Diego&#039;s Sweetwater High School is in one of the districts offering AP Computer Science Principles, the College Board course debuting across the country during the 2016-2017 academic year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;About five years ago, a student asked Arthur Lopez, a Sweetwater High School teacher who taught computer applications courses, why high schools in the more affluent areas of the county, La Jolla and Torrey Pines, offered computer science classes when his did not. Of the student body at Sweetwater High School, 85 percent were on free or reduced-price lunch programs last year. There were no computer science courses available in the Sweetwater Union High School District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It just hit me, right then and there, really hard, that this was an inequity access issue,&quot; Lopez says. &quot;My kids were not being given the same opportunities that other children were being given to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-01-30/major-push-by-white-house-to-increase-computer-science-skills&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; color: rgb(44, 126, 240); line-height: inherit;&quot;&gt;computer science courses&lt;/a&gt;, and then exposure to computer science, which arguably would lead to the highest-paying jobs in the world.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computing is at the base of scientific innovation, and the need to understand it is critical not only for a STEM job, but for any career, he adds. &quot;I just thought, &#039;This is criminal. How can we not offer them these types of courses?&#039;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the most recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usnews.com/news/stem-index/articles/2015/06/29/gender-racial-gaps-widen-in-stem-fields?int=a77009&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; color: rgb(44, 126, 240); line-height: inherit;&quot; title=&quot;Link: http://www.usnews.com/news/stem-index/articles/2015/06/29/gender-racial-gaps-widen-in-stem-fields?int=a77009&quot;&gt;U.S. News/Raytheon STEM Index&lt;/a&gt;, computer science jobs are helping to boost U.S. wages. Among the top 10 STEM-related fields with the greatest number of employees, seven – including applications software engineers and computer support specialists – directly involve computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lopez says his principal gave him the green light to find a computer science course they could potentially bring to the school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A colleague alerted Lopez to an introductory computer science principles course developed and taught by Beth Simon, on the faculty of the education studies and computer science and engineering departments at the University of California—San Diego and a member of the College Board&#039;s AP Computer Science Principles Advisory Board. Run by San Diego State University and the San Diego Supercomputer Center at UCSD, the course was supported by the National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lopez took the course at UCSD, his alma mater, in early 2012, and says he was impressed. He observed psychology majors become engaged and interested in computing, computer science and computational thinking through a teaching methodology that included peer-to-peer collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon&#039;s curriculum became a model for a computer science principles course at Sweetwater High School during the 2012-2013 school year. In fall 2012, Lopez heard about the College Board&#039;s pilot program, applied and was accepted to become one of its instructors the following year. In Sweetwater Union High School District, there are now 11 high schools offering AP and non-AP computer science courses. Lopez teaches AP Computer Science Principles at Sweetwater High School, and is the district&#039;s curriculum specialist for computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;AP Computer Science Principles stemmed from a conversation between Janice Cuny, program director for broadening participation and education in computing, and the College Board. Trevor Packer, senior vice president of advanced placement and college readiness at the College Board, says that Cuny contacted him and explained the concern over the low percentage of high school students, particularly women, taking computer science, and how this didn&#039;t match with the large number of professional opportunities that require computing degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;And U.S. News&#039; STEM Index shows that women lag behind men in the number of STEM degrees granted, exam scores and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usnews.com/news/stem-index/articles/2015/06/29/the-2015-us-news-raytheon-stem-index&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; color: rgb(44, 126, 240); line-height: inherit;&quot;&gt;general interest in the STEM fields&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuny, who had been a faculty member of computer science departments at Purdue University, the University of Massachusetts and the University of Oregon for a collective 22 years, says she realized that to address low enrollment in computer science at the college level, it was necessary to look at K-12 programming. She says that if students graduate high school without exposure to computer science, by the time they take a college course, it can be be too late to pursue a degree in the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuny says she chose to concentrate on high school because there are many engagement programs for younger students with animation and music systems, e-textiles and robotics, for instance, but that if the continuity of that learning is broken, the students might lose interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;callout-left&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 1.5rem 0.9375rem 0px; padding: 0px; width: auto; float: left; max-width: 300px;&quot;&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The AP Computer Science Principles course is designed in part to encourage more women and minorities to study computer science.&quot; class=&quot;block-tight border&quot; src=&quot;https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/e0f6ef8/2147483647/resize/300x%3E/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F27%2F7d%2F48d6301049c6a4024d2ca3036ff3%2Fdigitalcreativitycollaboration2-crop.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid rgb(221, 221, 221); box-sizing:inherit; display:block; margin:auto; max-width:100%&quot; title=&quot;(Courtesy Richard Kick)&quot; /&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto&quot;&gt;The AP Computer Science Principles course is designed in part to encourage more women and minorities to study computer science.&lt;span&gt;(COURTESY RICHARD KICK)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the American education system is decentralized, Cuny says she thought enlisting the College Board would be a way to obtain national reach since its courses were already offered in so many schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the College Board presented the idea of the principles course to its membership of colleges, universities and high schools, Packer says it learned that if it were to offer only one course, professors did not want its AP Computer Science A course eliminated because it is the fundamental starting point for students majoring in the subject. The consensus was to offer both courses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Science Foundation provided an award to the College Board in 2008 for that initial meeting of stakeholders, with additional funding for the development and piloting of the course framework and later the exam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Very few students are going to decide to be French majors if their first introduction to French is an intensive grammar course. Whereas if you started students with a course that provided a more expansive introduction to French language and culture, that exposed them to the array of different things one might do with the French language, and not just an intensive grammar course, chances are, the students will be much more interested in pursuing studies in French.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Kick&#039;s knowledge of computing education runs deep: He began teaching mathematics and computer science in 1980, and four years later taught one of the first AP computer science classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In addition to algorithms and programming, the course discusses creativity, abstraction, data and information, The Internet and Global Impact and covers six computational thinking practices: connecting computing, creating computational artifacts, abstracting, analyzing problems and artifacts, communicating and collaborating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

He noted that students address the interplay among computing, computer science and all other fields of study, looking specifically at digital communication and the influence of computing innovations on society, economy and culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We realized that people are not successful just because of knowledge. They&#039;re successful because of the things they can do computationally,&quot; Kick says. &quot;We&#039;re focusing not just on the knowledge we want students to have, but the practices and experiences we want them to have before they leave the course.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teachers select the programming language for instruction (JavaScript, block languages, etc.) and, based upon observations from the pilot groups, they may look at more than one depending on the students&#039; backgrounds, says Maureen Reyes, senior director, AP program management at the College Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting the goal of engaging students creatively, the AP Computer Science Principles exam is comprised of two projects and an end-of-year test. For one project, students submit a digital artifact such as a video or audio file to explain the technology development within a computer science application like cybersecurity protocols or voice recognition software, Packer says. For the second, students choose a programming language and build an application, writing about the process afterward and discussing how they may have corrected any coding errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To recruit students, Lopez says he speaks to middle and high school classes, challenging the students to think of a career that does not involve computing, citing musicians who make electronic recordings and developers of apps or video games. He might also talk about how knowledge of computing can contribute to community-based problems, such as teaching the elderly to use technology or tackling issues surrounding water, energy and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuny says that collaboration and project-based learning are two means of addressing the equity factor when it comes to inclusion and engagement among all students. Early computing courses may be filled with students who have grown up with computers and the jargon and classmates who are starting from the beginning, she explains. When students contribute to teams, it allows them to &quot;come up to speed at slightly different levels,&quot; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Liu was one of Kick&#039;s AP Computer Science Principles students as a high school senior. This fall, he plans to attend the University of California—Riverside and to major in cognitive science. He says that he began experimenting as a sixth grader with computer programming on an old Casio graphing calculator before moving on to more complex aspects of computer science a couple of years later. Even though he says he was already knowledgeable about the subject prior to taking the course, and was simultaneously enrolled in AP Computer Science A, &quot;what I hadn&#039;t done was apply … the skills I picked up to do random creative things,&quot; he says. &quot;When I took [AP Computer Science Principles], that was the new experience I got.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You were able to do some really amazing things, and you saw other students doing really amazing things, and it was really just a matter of how creative you were and how much time you wanted to spend, rather than how much you actually knew going into the class.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years prior, Emily Reimal took Kick&#039;s principles class during her sophomore year. She says that she was nervous about enrolling because she didn&#039;t know much about programming and doubted her math skills, but that her adviser and Kick encouraged her to sign up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reimal says her confidence grew, and she went on to take AP Computer Science A. As a senior, she re-enrolled in AP Computer Science Principles as an independent study where she also worked on her own side projects and says she especially enjoyed furthering her knowledge of HTML, coding and adjusting websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-in-text-target &quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now a student at the University of Maryland—College Park, Reimal is scheduled to graduate in December with a bachelor&#039;s in criminology and criminal justice and is currently a justice policy research intern at the Urban Institute. Reimal says that without her high school computer science experience, she would not have felt comfortable learning SPSS, software for statistics, in college or Stata, another program for data analysis and statistical work, at her internship. &quot;It&#039;s possible I wouldn&#039;t be where I am now,&quot; she says. &quot;Even though I don&#039;t use the same languages [as in high school], I definitely have the confidence.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report Tells the Story of AP CSP&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;On September 14, 2016, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy held a Summit on Computer Science (CS) for All. &lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/01/30/computer-science-all&quot;&gt;CS for All&lt;/a&gt; leverages new and existing efforts to promote and scale computer science education in every community in America. Learning computer science prepares students to successfully participate in our technology-driven world. (You can watch a recording of the Summit on CS for All &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiZLuHfvvYI&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was invited to speak at the Summit on CS for All to announce the launch of the new AP Computer Science Principles course. More than 2,000 schools have indicated they are offering the course to roughly 25,000 students this fall, making it the largest AP course launch ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AP Computer Science Principles was designed with the goal of creating leaders in computer science fields and attracting and engaging diverse populations of students. Not only is AP Computer Science Principles a rigorous course, but it also introduces essential computer science concepts in relevant contexts. It aims to appeal to underrepresented groups, including females and students of color, by giving students opportunities to use computer science to address real-world issues and gain skills relevant across other disciplines and industries. Students learn to create programs or technologies that have practical impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional development for educators is necessary to expanding AP Computer Science Principles. To that end, the AP Program hosted more than 70 AP Summer Institutes in 2016, training 1,400 teachers. The Program has also endorsed five curriculum and professional development providers to ensure that schools and teachers have high-quality options for implementing AP Computer Science Principles. You can find these resources (and learn how they were selected) &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/stem/computer-science-principles/curricula-pedagogical-support&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board appreciates the support of—and our collaboration with—the National Science Foundation during the development of AP Computer Science Principles, as well as the hundreds of secondary and post-secondary educators who piloted and helped develop the course at their institutions. We couldn’t have done it without their dedication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One AP Computer Science Principles teacher, Art Lopez,  especially embraced this opportunity to bring computer science to his school, Sweetwater High School, a low-income school south of San Diego, CA, and his district. He was a pilot teacher for several years, and during that time he helped prepare teachers from eleven other high schools in Sweetwater Union District to teach AP Computer Science Principles at their own schools this fall. In his class, students learn to solve problems, collaborate, and express their solutions with the computer programs they write. As a testament to his efforts, one of his students, Karla Gonzales, said, “Taking the Computer Science Principles course changed my perspective of school and about myself. I truly believe computer science is a valuable course in a student’s academic career. Not many courses can teach creativity like computer science can.” The course gave Gonzales more self-confidence as she honed in on the creative aspects, and it encouraged her to pursue a degree in computer science, which she is now doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our economy changes and the number of jobs requiring a computer science background increases, there’s a pressing need to recognize the importance of computer science education. AP Computer Science Principles helps students learn how they can apply computer science knowledge and skills to a broad range of fields and interests, including science, technology, engineering, art, mathematics (STEAM) and other computing disciplines.  Armed with such skills, students will have broader prospects for social mobility in our country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;AP Computer Science Principles Celebrated at White House Summit&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval &lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.nv.gov/News-and-Media/Press/2016/Governor-Sandoval-Proclaims-December-as-Computer-Science-Careers-Month-and-Announces-Statewide-Computer-Science-Education-Initiatives/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Monday a partnership with the College Board and Code.org to pilot an initiative offering two new computer science courses, AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) and Computer Science Discoveries, in every school district in Nevada, beginning in the 2017-2018 school year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Computing is one of the top sources of new wages in our nation and there are thousands of current jobs and jobs of the future that will request skills in computer science. I believe it is critical that Nevada students have every option available to learn the necessary skills to begin a career in this exciting, high-wage, high-skilled field,” said Governor Brian Sandoval &lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.nv.gov/News-and-Media/Press/2016/Governor-Sandoval-Proclaims-December-as-Computer-Science-Careers-Month-and-Announces-Statewide-Computer-Science-Education-Initiatives/&quot;&gt;in his announcement.&lt;/a&gt; “This partnership with Code.org and College Board is an important first step toward providing great STEM and computer science access to classrooms across Nevada.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid growth of computer science course is undeniable. In its inaugural year, more than 2,500 teachers submitted syllabi for &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/stem/computer-science-principles?excmpid=MTG272-PR-1-prt&quot;&gt;AP Computer Science Principles&lt;/a&gt; (AP CSP), making it the largest AP course launch in history. AP CSP is being offered in 49 states, with approximately 25,000 students participating. The College Board has trained 2,600 educators to teach AP CSP, and 200 more have received scholarships to train for the course during Summer Institutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the College Board’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-a&quot;&gt;AP Computer Science A&lt;/a&gt; course continues to be the fastest growing AP course. With 57,937 students took the exam this year – an 18 percent increase from 48,994 in 2015. The number of students taking the course has more than doubled in the past five years, from 21,139 examinees in 2011 to 57,937 in 2016. The number of female examinees for AP Computer Science A increased from 18 percent in 2006 to 23 percent in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just how are these courses affecting students? At first, Karla Gonzalez, who participated in the AP Computer Science Principles pilot at Sweetwater High School in National City, California, was intimidated by computer science since she had very little experience with it. However, once she took the course, it opened her eyes to what the discipline is all about – especially the creativity aspect. Karla was inspired by the course to pursue a computer science major in college; her ultimate dream is now to work for Pixar. She is the first member of her family to attend college and currently attends San Diego Mesa Community College, with aspirations of transferring to a university that has a high-quality computer science program such as the University of California, San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Karla, today’s students know computer science is the new literacy – and these advanced courses are helping to shape the future of a tech-focused workforce. The introduction of AP Computer Science Principles follows an industry trend of involving more young women and underrepresented minorities in STEM. In fact, in a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/17/fact-sheet-president-obama-announces-high-school-graduation-rate-has&quot;&gt;White House announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the successful launch of AP Computer Science Principles was listed among “key signs” that “the country has made real progress to increase educational opportunity and help students succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;The College Board Celebrates #CSEdWeek&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The interview below has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trevor Packer&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Art Lopez&lt;/strong&gt; is here with us today from Sweetwater High School in National City, California. He was one of the teachers who piloted the new AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He realized that while many of the more affluent schools in his community were already offering computer science courses, students at his school—which was a majority minority school—were not getting that same opportunities. He set out to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me also introduce &lt;strong&gt;Susan Van Doren&lt;/strong&gt; from George Whittell High School in Lake Tahoe, Nevada. She went from teaching English to teaching Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles. She has achieved the rare feat of having a 50 percent female/50 percent male student ratio, which rarely happens in computer science classrooms in American education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Art, what inspired you to teach computer science? Why did you decide to do that, and what was it like to start teaching it in a school that had no computer science at all?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Art Lopez:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, about six years ago, one of my students came up to me and said, hey, Mr. Lopez, why do La Jolla High School and Torrey Pines High School offer computer science courses, and not Sweetwater High?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I said you know what, that’s a really great question. I went ahead and started investigating, and what I found really, really upset me. I realized that not only do we have a digital divide, but we also have an issue of equity and access. The kids in my community were not being exposed to computer science, and yet, I will state this very clearly—computer science and computer-related fields would offer our kids the highest-paying jobs in the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realized around that time that, for 25 years, not a single computer science course had been taught within our district. We had 13 high schools, plus middle schools, and we have 42,000 kids. So, along with my then principal, Dr. Romando Rosario, I said, let’s do something about this. Let’s change it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coincidentally, in that moment, we had a group from UC San Diego, University of California San Diego, and the San Diego Supercomputer Center that was working alongside with the National Science Foundation and the College Board to provide an introductory computer science course to kids. I was interested—I did not have a computer science background, and I had no idea how to teach the course, but I just said, you know what? I don’t care. I want my kids to get this course inside our high school. So they provided me with the training, the resources, and the curriculum, and the College Board gave me the opportunity to join the pilot program. They were searching for inner-city schools like my own. My school is 98 percent ethnically-diverse. We have 85-88% percent of students on the free or reduced lunch programs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a village to do all this. It’s not one person that drives it. It was my former principal, my current principal, our superintendent, our school board, our higher education colleagues, the College Board, and the National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I am so happy to report that we have 11 AP CSP courses taught in 13 high schools. And on top of that, we have AP Computer Science A courses offered now. We have 44 computer science courses spread out through our district. It’s been a long journey, and it’s been really empowering to watch what’s occurred. It’s always about kids, and this whole process is about equity access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packer: Art, I’ve known you for a while. This is the first time I’ve heard that you weren’t teaching computer science before you began this work. What were you teaching before? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lopez&lt;/strong&gt;: I don’t have computer science background, but I can say clearly that computer science has made me a much better thinker. I can demonstrate that with my kids, because we learn from each other every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packer: Susan, I’m curious to know what made you think that, as an English teacher, you could become a computer science teacher—how did you go about it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Susan Van Doren&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, it certainly wasn’t my idea. It started when my son was in fifth grade. We went on to my computer and we watched a video for the Hour of Code, and he talked to me about what coding was, and he was very excited—we watched videos of people running scooters around the Google offices, and he said, that’s the kind of job I want to have someday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I started doing the Hour of Code in my English classes, and I did that for a couple of years. And two years ago, while I was doing it in my ninth grade English class, I saw students that I had never seen engaged before in education—students who I always struggled with, students who didn’t participate—and they were so passionate about what they were doing. They were solving problems, and they were talking to each other about what they were doing with code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it just hit me that this can’t be just an hour out of their school year. I needed to see them this excited on a prolonged level. And so I started a little computer club—and it started &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three or four students came in after school, and we started using Google CS first. This program that made it really easy for someone like me, who had no computer science background, to just suddenly start getting the kids involved in it. All of the videos were there, and I was learning right alongside them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then those students said, why aren’t we doing this as a class? We’re learning a lot here through using things like Scratch to create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so I said, I don’t know why we’re not doing it as a class! I started researching, and I saw the AP Computer Science Principles class. But it was still in the pilot phase, so I tried to get it on the schedule for the following year, and tried to get certified to teach it. I persisted, and I started taking night classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packer: That’s a lot of work? Why were you doing it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Van Doren:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, because the kids wanted it. I’m from a very small school—there are 200 kids, grades seven through 12. We’re a family, and I wanted what they wanted. They brought it to me and said, we want to do this, so I just kept pushing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had to sell it to the district, and then I put together a presentation for a tech conference to say we needed computer science in our schools. But then I wasn’t able to make it to the tech conference, and I thought oh, this is terrible—I’m missing my chance to pitch this to the administration and to the teachers in the district.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then my kids said well, we’ll present it! So I had seven kids in my AP computer science class give the presentation, which ended up being so much more powerful. They talked about how in 2013, we had 51 students in the state of Nevada who took the AP Computer Science A Exam, and only three of them were girls. And that seemed really low for an entire state. But then they talked about talked about what they were doing in computer science club, and that they wanted to have this class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago we had our first AP Computer Science A class, and this year we had our first AP Computer Science Principles class. When we did the first AP CSP class, we had 20 students; 10 of them were girls. This year we have 37 students, and 18 of them are girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packer: How does that compare to enrollment in other classes in your school?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Van Doren:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it’s the only AP class we’ve ever had, and we had to have two sections of it. So it’s very high. We have about 30 percent of our high school’s population taking AP Computer Science this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Coleman&lt;/strong&gt;: I’ve talked about rural American high schools, and the problem of getting to size and scale here. But I just hope all of us can imagine how easy a fate it is that this course doesn’t begin at all in rural schools—how much depends on teachers like Susan here, and why we as a College Board must now do everything we can to support them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m very moved by Susan’s personal transformation, and the fact that she’s transforming the number of young women in Nevada in one of the smallest schools around. We at the College Board are very impressed, and I just wanted to underscore the other non-profits that are so essential to this story: Code.org, our terrific partner in implementing this course, they developed the Hour of Code, and they should be honored for that and their contribution. The National Science Foundation—with their visionary leadership—came to us over 10 years ago with the idea that the education of computer science must change in this country. And Project Lead The Way—we partner with them closely to ensure that students see the linkage to their careers. I only emphasize these things because it really is a network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Van Doren: &lt;/strong&gt;Absolutely. Like Art said, we don’t do this on our own. I had a very supportive principal who, when I first told him I want to teach computer science, never said no, and he always supported me. And we have incredibly supportive parents in the district who got behind the idea. Even community members that don’t have children supported me financially and also just sat down and tutored me in Python. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s very humbling for me to be put back in the situation of being a learner who was struggling with something. For me to learn Python is I think like the experience that some of my English students have when they sit down to read Thoreau. Now I’m more empathetic with them when they’re struggling. So it has made me a better English teacher as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packer: Sometimes the discipline can seem a little bit mysterious to people outside of it. Can you talk a little bit about the sort of work your students are doing? What are they creating? What projects are they working on? What do you see them do in the class?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lopez:&lt;/strong&gt; We use a program in class called Alice, and it allows kids to create interactive, animated short stories and simple video games, and it’s really cool and compelling because they have to be creative. They have ideas that I would never even think about, and they create these really funny stories, and I just crack up. I ask, how did they do that? They teach me as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that’s the foundational principle for this course—it allows kids to expand their creativity. They actually think of an idea they want to make happen on the computer, and it’s compelling to watch them explore. They really have a great mindset. Though a lot of my kids, especially the young ones, struggled with the fact that they’re really intimidated. They weren’t sure about the class, but once they start exploring and they start learning, they thought, oh, well, this isn’t that hard. We’re using block programing languages versus text-based languages, and that’s really helped. The best thing about this class is that it does teach kids how to think!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think everybody in this country should take the class. It can help you learn how to think, and it’s also empowering— it raises confidence. It raises what kids can achieve and what they can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s wonderful to watch kids exploring how computing works in so many different fields. It makes kids realize that no matter what they’re going to pursue in their future endeavors, computing is going to be a part of it. For example, I have kids that want to go into the medical fields. They want to be doctors. And now they want to get a computer science degree, you know, because it goes hand in hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packer: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes. You know, Code.org’s website shows so powerfully that in every state, the number of open jobs that require a computing background vastly exceeds the number of college graduates that can fill those needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lopez&lt;/strong&gt;: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packer&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt; Do you see students taking your class and then choosing to major in computer science?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lopez&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s convincing a lot of my kids to pursue computer science degrees, and it really is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is Adrian Avalos. He’s now decided to attend Stanford. He got in. He took several AP courses, and he’s thinking about now going into computer science because of the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another young lady, Carla Gonzales, didn’t know what she wanted to do. But she decided after taking this class that she wants to be a computer scientist. Her dream is to work for Pixar. She’s challenged herself for now to start up at the community college, but she is driven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I talked to her about two weeks ago, and I said how’s it going? She said, pretty good! I’m taking more computer science classes that are harder than yours, but—because of AP CSP she understands the difficult abstract concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course raises the level of curiosity, and I think that’s the best thing you can do. The students want to learn. It’s really great to see that I now have a bunch of kids who want to take AP Computer Science A. That’s encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packer: Susan, one last question for you. You have achieved this sort of rarity of having a female-male student balance in your computer science classroom. Tell us how.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lopez:&lt;/strong&gt; I also want to know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Van Doren:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve wondered about that a lot myself, and I think that it’s a combination of factors. Partly it’s because I’m a girl and I’m teaching the class; I joke about that, but I think also we need to see what we can do to get more female educators teaching computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also done some outreach beyond my classroom, beyond computer club. I have a fellow STEM leader at my school who teaches AP Bio and AP Environmental Science, and we work together at the summer camp for our kids, grades three through eight. We do a lot of fun activities with the kids (and the high school-age camp counselors) with Scratch and other aspects of STEM, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also did something we call the “STEM GEM Slumber Party.” That was led by one of my senior girls, Kelsea Parks, who is now at the University of Nevada Reno studying computer science, as a Girl Scouts project. We invited all the girls in the high school to come and spend the night, and we watched Code Girls and had little contests designing apps and doing Scratch Projects and a digital scavenger hunt. Some of them stayed up all night, some of them crashed in the hallways—it was a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We surveyed the girls, when they came in and when they left, about their interest in science or computer science. About 15 percent said they were interested in taking a computer science class when they came in, and when they left, it was up to 85-90 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we did some things to explicitly attract girls to the course. But also, I think back to 1984 when I was in high school, and I remember walking down the hallways and seeing a computer lab that was more like a closet with a couple of computers in it, and you know, a bunch of guys sitting around. And I remember walking by and looking at it, and feeling that little jolt of curiosity, but then I just kept walking, because it didn’t look like a place that was welcoming to me. I think part of doing this successfully is getting some girls involved, and the rest will follow. I’ve been lucky to be in a school where I have some very strong female students that are passionate, excited, and confident, and they are coming to my class and other girls are following&lt;/p&gt;

The course covers working with data and understanding the internet and cyber security, and it teaches ‘transferable skills,’ he said, like formulating precise questions. That’s a departure from what the College Board found in many high schools…The goal is that the new course will be offered in every high school in the country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/04/education/edlife/AP-Coding-Quiz.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interactive quiz&lt;/a&gt;, which allows &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;readers to test their computational thinking skills with practice AP CSP Exam questions, accompanied the article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about AP Computer Science Principles, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/stem/computer-science-principles?excmpid=MTG272-PR-1-prt&quot;&gt;collegeboard.org/apcsp&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;AP CSP in the NYT&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Today, we build on that momentum with more news: &lt;strong&gt;The College Board and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) are launching a two-year partnership that will help millions of students better prepare for college and career. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we look at students in America, we see incredible talent, but there are too many barriers in the way,” said College Board President David Coleman. “The College Board and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative are united in our belief that if we clear a path for all students, they won’t just walk down it, they’ll run.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board will dramatically expand access to unique, personalized learning pathways—including PSAT-related assessments, interactive SAT practice, and Advanced Placement courses—all of which help prepare and propel students forward and identify a postsecondary program that best fits their needs and passions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Said Jim Shelton, president of education for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative: “The work being done by the College Board to help students tailor their SAT practice and prepare for college is a promising approach to scaling personalized learning. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is proud to support the College Board in its effort to reach more students across the country and fundamentally improve the access, experience, and preparation they make available to each student.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE WORK AHEAD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership will enable the College Board to bring to scale successful initiatives, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introducing more students &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which provides free, world-class and personalized online study tools for all students to prepare for the SAT. Newly released data link Official SAT Practice to substantial score gains from the PSAT/NMSQT to the SAT. Research confirmed that practice on Khan Academy advanced students regardless of gender, race, income, and high school GPA. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Connecting more students to near-peer advisers through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://advisingcorps.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;College Advising Corps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (CAC). CAC advisers are recent college graduates, many the first in their family to attend college, who serve full time in underrepresented high schools across the United States, providing personalized advice to high school students about navigating the path to college.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Helping to bring &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/stem/computer-science-principles&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AP Computer Science Principles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (AP CSP) to every school district in the country, with a special focus on rural communities. The course, which launched in 2016, is transforming the way that students, especially underrepresented and female students, begin studying STEM subjects. AP CSP goes beyond coding, introducing students to the foundational concepts of computer science and challenging them to explore how technology can impact the world, with a focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a special focus on students in lower-income communities and rural areas, the College Board will also collaborate with other organizations who work closely with students and educators, including the Council of the Great City Schools, the National Rural Education Association, TNTP, Character Lab, and Stanford University, and districts and states across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you hear the words “computer science,” do you imagine someone sitting in front of a computer alone, typing code all day and night? Think again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaila Piscitelli was a student at Conrad High School in Connecticut when she created an app that recommends clothes a traveler should pack based on weather forecasts. Her classmate, Lily Sientab, built an app that teaches younger students the alphabet. Hamed Nassaco—who attended the Academy for Software Engineering in New York—uses computer code to write songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These students brought their ideas to life in AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP). This new Advanced Placement course from the College Board invites students—even those with no previous coding or programming experience—to use computing tools and skills to pursue their own interests, showcase their creativity, and address real-world issues in their community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like other Advanced Placement courses, AP CSP is a college-level course students can take while in high school. The framework for each AP course is created by a panel of experts and college-level educators from each specific field of study. American colleges and universities may grant placement and course credit to students who get qualifying scores on AP Exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning the basics of computer science can lead to hundreds of career choices, from engineering, law, and medicine to animation, visual arts, and music. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that more than nine million STEM jobs will open up over the next decade, and half of those will require a computing background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, through our own research, the College Board has learned that many students who have the potential to succeed in advanced computer science coursework never seize that opportunity—especially female, African American, and Latino students. And we know from the National Science Foundation—a partner in our AP CSP work—that the number of women graduating with computer science degrees is nearly half of what it was in the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By broadening the invitation, and working with our partners at Code.org, Project Lead the Way, states like Kentucky, and districts across the country, we’re working to make computer science education much more widely available to young women, students of color, and students in rural communities. More than 2,500 schools offered AP CSP this fall, and 350 colleges and counting award college credit and placement to students who pass their AP CSP Exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All students deserve access to the technology and skills they&#039;ll need to succeed in the future. Studying computer science is about using one elaborate tool to solve real-life problems, creatively and collaboratively. In the words of one AP CSP teacher from California, Art Lopez: “If you learn about computer science, you have the ability to change the world.” Lily Sientab, the alphabet-teaching app designer, agrees. “This class is about taking your own ideas and implementing them to create something new. Computer science has shown me that I can try, and try again, and actually accomplish what I set my mind to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
