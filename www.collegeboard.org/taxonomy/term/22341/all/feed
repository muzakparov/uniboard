Since the announcement, state officials, education leaders, and news outlets have voiced support for the change that will allow Michigan students, parents, and educators to take advantage of the opportunities College Board redesigned assessments have to offer. We&#039;re pleased to share a great editorial from the Detroit News. The full text and a link to the original article can be found below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State scores in switch to SAT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michigan students will take new college entrance exam in 2016, saving state money&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally posted on January 9 on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/01/09/michigan-chooses-sat-act/21458857/&quot;&gt;The Detroit News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to keep track of all the acronyms that fly around the education sphere, but the Michigan Department of Education’s decision to move to the SAT from the ACT is a significant change. While some school officials aren’t happy about dealing with a new test, it’s a switch that will save taxpayers money — and offer students some additional benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2007, all Michigan high school juniors have been required to take the ACT college entrance exam as part of the Michigan Merit Exam, in part to encourage more students to apply to college. Michigan law requires high school students to take a college entrance exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move to the SAT, starting in 2016, should be fairly seamless for students, according to department officials and some education reform experts. Like the ACT, the SAT will be offered free of charge to all juniors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everyone is pleased with this change. Some school administrators feel blindsided and upset they now have to meet a new target after years of building a curriculum around the ACT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Department officials should take these concerns seriously, especially since so much pressure is placed on schools to meet certain benchmarks on these tests. More leniency should be afforded schools as they transition to this new standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the financial savings are real, and it would have been careless of state officials to ignore that. The MDE said the College Board, which administers the SAT, won the three-year contract worth $17.1 million — a bid that was $15 million less than the ACT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Superintendent Mike Flanagan thinks this is a positive change, and points to how the SAT test “is respected and used around the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Their bid was rated the highest; provides valuable assistance to Michigan educators, students, and parents; is more aligned to Michigan’s content standards; and saves the state millions of dollars over the course of the three-year contract,” Flanagan said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MDE says to prepare for the new test, students can take practice tests, and teachers and other school officials will participate in professional development. This training is covered under the SAT contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students will benefit from these additional training opportunities. The College Board has partnered with Kahn Academy, the free, online learning resource, to provide free SAT preparation materials to all students starting in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Ackley, spokesman for the department, says nearly all colleges — including all universities in Michigan — accept the SAT test as well as the ACT, so students won’t be at a disadvantage for not taking the ACT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SAT tests students in reading, writing and math; the ACT has five parts: English, mathematics, reading, science and an optional writing test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education experts who have looked at the revamped SAT test — the one students will start taking in 2016 — say it will be more aligned to Michigan standards. Those include: requiring to back up claims, testing vocabulary in reading passages, fewer math topics but in more depth, and testing knowledge of U.S. founding documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition to the SAT will inevitably pose challenges at first, but the savings for the state and the added benefits for students made this the right call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Positive Response to Michigan SAT Announcement &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>Jalen Rose Leadership Academy to Expand Opportunity for Detroit Students Through New Focus on AP Courses</title>

Starting in 2017, the public charter school in Northwest Detroit will require that every student take a least one AP course as a requirement for graduation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My vision in founding JRLA was to provide Detroit families with a quality private school education in a tuition-free public school setting,” Mr. Rose explained. “To realize that vision, we have to set academic standards of excellence and provide the kind of rigorous curriculum that is common to the best private high schools. Partnering with the College Board to introduce Advanced Placement courses on a grand scale at our open admission Detroit high school is a natural progression as we continue to raise the bar,” the former NBA star and current ABC/ESPN Analyst declared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jalen Rose Leadership Academy will be the first school in Detroit to establish that its students – referred to as scholars - take an AP course as a graduation requirement. All students, save those with certain special needs, will be expected to meet this requirement. Additionally, any JRLA scholar on a path to a four-year college will be encouraged to take four AP courses, one in each core area of science, math, English, and social studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wendell Hall, Senior Director for Policy at the College Board, attended the event to support the kick off of the ambitious program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The College Board is committed to ensuring that all students who have the potential to succeed in AP courses are able to access those opportunities,” he said. “That is why we work with schools like the Jalen Rose Leadership Academy to remove barriers and expand opportunity. We thank JLRA for its efforts to provide access to the challenging course work that will prepare students for success in college.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with the Jalen Rose Leadership Academy to provide the AP program to its scholars is a part of the College Board’s efforts to deliver opportunity to students everywhere. Through the &lt;em&gt;All In&lt;/em&gt; campaign, the College Board is committed to working with educators to break down barriers and ensure that 100 percent of African American, Hispanic, and Native American students with the potential to succeed in AP enroll in at least one matched AP course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rose stated that this commitment to raise the bar for students at Jalen Rose Leadership Academy reflects his belief that the majority of Detroit children who go to regular open-admission high schools have the same ability and promise as those accepted to the special test-admission schools in the city such as Renaissance High School and Cass Tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s time we set the same high expectations for all our students as we do for those who attend private or special admissions schools.  I have no doubt our scholars will rise to the occasion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jalen Rose Leadership Academy is managed by the non-profit &lt;a href=&quot;http://promiseschools.org/&quot;&gt;American Promise Schools (APS).&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.voyageurcollegeprep.com/&quot;&gt;Consortium College Prep&lt;/a&gt;, the other high school APS manages in Detroit, has made a similar commitment to increase its graduation requirements and introduce AP courses at an ambitious scale.&lt;/p&gt;
