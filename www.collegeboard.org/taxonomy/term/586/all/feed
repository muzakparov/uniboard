She spoke to All Access this summer about why the arts are important — to her, and to all students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Access: What’s the most critical issue in arts education today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pamela Paulson: It’s really the same issue in education in general — the inequity of access to a rich curriculum, one that challenges kids and supports them so they can reach their potential. Sometimes the classes are less than inspiring, and many students tune out because they haven’t found something that sparks their interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kids from wealthy families find their way to the arts, while poor and underrepresented kids often end up missing out on the very opportunities that might be the most inspiring for them. They need to be exposed to high-quality arts learning that will both challenge them and support their brain development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes down to access for all students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: Do you have an arts background?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PP:  I majored in dance in college, which surprised my family — they thought I would major in math or science because I was in accelerated classes in high school. But when I arrived on my college’s campus, I went to a big auditorium to find out which classes had open seats. I got to the dance registration table, and since I had been a gymnast in high school, I decided on the spot that I would major in dance. When I told my father, he didn’t say anything negative about my decision, but he was worried I wouldn’t be able to find a paying job. Luckily I’ve never had a day of unemployment in my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often say that in the arts, you are probably better prepared for the future because most of your jobs will be created by you. You’re often at the bottom of the heap as an artist and arts educator, and you often don’t have a lot of money, but you always have an inner focus and passion for imagining, creating, innovating, and making your own path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arts are the best preparation for life — they give you focus, persistence, refinement, flexibility, and a love of what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: How does role at the College Board enhance your day-to-day work in the arts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PP: I started working on the College Board’s Arts Academic Committee in 1997, and it’s been an incredibly rewarding experience. I’ve always felt that the College Board valued the arts and treated them as equal to math and science; that has allowed us to have some wonderful conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board has such high expectations for kids and that’s really important. I love that there are opportunities for external measures of student performance, such as the AP® and AP Capstone™ courses and exams. In the arts we always say students need to do “real work for real audiences,” and they have to understand that there are high expectations. When you leave the stage as an artist, you hope that what you’ve done is of the highest quality so you feel pride in your performance and have communicated your message. The College Board sheds light on that process of practice and performance and helps us communicate that to our students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: In your mind, how essential is the College Board’s purpose statement of “challenging all students to own their future”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PP: When I think about the future, I think that we’re challenging students to be their best. They are going to be the citizens running the world. They will live and lead in the future. In order to have a democracy where ideas matter, where people discuss and debate, you have to have educated people. So students have a huge responsibility to be educated. Without education, they won’t have enough experience or insight to help make the decisions that will affect people who live in their community, state, country, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: What do you love about your job?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PP: I feel so lucky to have art in my life. I get to walk through our high school every day and see art on the walls and see students making art in the studios. I give tours to our many visitors and can show them that students are making artwork that expresses powerful ideas. Students have great insights and can lift you up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talk primarily about students because they are the focus of our school, but I find equal joy in doing workshops for teachers, whether on our campus or in schools around the state. We always have teachers creating art, and you see those same positive things start to happen that you see with students. In these moments they are more alive — they are actually making something, creating, working collaboratively, and expressing ideas. You can feel a new energy in the room and in their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: How do you infuse art into your personal life? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PP:  I still perform in informal settings. Down the street from my house is a Unitarian church, and when they have solstice performances and need performers, I will occasionally dance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I was part of a flash mob in a large office tower downtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, my son, who has learning disabilities, is a photographer. I think that’s one of the ways I’ve gotten immersed in art lately, by helping him find a way to express his ideas. I don’t have his eye for photography, but I’ve helped him put up some shows. I’ve tried to help him find his voice through his art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Trustee Pam Paulson on the Importance of the Arts&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Doug Christiansen, chair of the College Board&#039;s Board of Trustees, shared the following advice:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “The college essay is one of the only places on an application where a student can let the admissions committee hear their authentic voice and one of the only places for students to differentiate themselves from an ever-increasing pool of applicants, Doug Christiansen, Vice Provost for University Enrollment Affairs and Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid at Vanderbilt University told NBC News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Most highly selective schools, such as Vanderbilt University, are looking for students who have learned from a personal experience and then utilized that knowledge to somehow make a positive difference in the world around them,’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Leadership during personally challenging times is important, but so is being part of a team working together to create something positive,’ he added. ‘At the end of the day, we want to know who you are and how your experiences have shaped you and the world around you.’”&lt;/p&gt;

The plan called for the construction of a performing arts center that would include classroom space and a 1,000+ seat theater.  The doors finally opened on the 1,049 seat OCCC Visual and Performing Arts Center Theater—fittingly on Valentine’s Day, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.428571429&quot;&gt;The sold out grand opening event featured a performance by the Oklahoma City Philharmonic and renowned pianist Valery Kuleshov. The Philharmonic, under the direction of Joel Levine, performed several pieces that included Tchaikovsky’s  “Fantasy Overture” and Rachmaninoff’s “Piano Concerto No. 3 in D minor, Op. 30” accompanied by Kuleshov.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.428571429&quot;&gt;The evening marked not only a significant accomplishment for the college, but also the underlying effect on students. “Involvement in the arts may be just what we need to be more successful as students, as a community, or as a nation,” said OCCC President Paul Sechrist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.428571429&quot;&gt;President Sechrist currently serves as a member of the Board of Trustees for the College Board.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.428571429&quot;&gt;“The value of the arts in education, regardless of a student’s area of interest, has a significant impact,” Sechrist said. “Students who participate in the arts are also far more likely to excel in science and mathematics. Low-income students who participate in the arts are more likely to graduate from high school and go on to college. College students of all majors are more likely to continue through graduation if they also sing in a choir, act in a play, or join the jazz band.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.428571429&quot;&gt;OCCC students agreed and have supported the project from the beginning. In 2006, students in the Leadership Council financially led the way for the theater by supporting an additional fee that provided $8 million dollars in bond funding for the theater project.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.428571429&quot;&gt;As students covered half of the estimated cost of the theater, gifts of $1 million dollars from the Sarkeys Foundation and $500,000 from the Inasmuch Foundation initiated a community fundraising campaign. Another two million dollars in donations from foundations, corporations and individuals, combined with OCCC capital improvement funds, set the stage for construction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.428571429&quot;&gt;The state-of-the-art facility was constructed in two phases. The college first completed the instruction side, which included rehearsal space, classrooms, library, studios and a variety of labs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.428571429&quot;&gt;Next was the theater, and after four years in construction, the Visual and Performing Arts Center Theater features state-of-art-equipment in a multipurpose hall that can accommodate any type of performance. Outside the performance hall, the atrium can accommodate 360 guests for pre-event receptions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.428571429&quot;&gt;Also included in the facility is the Inasmuch Foundation Art Gallery. The gallery opened with the art of former NBA basketball player and artist Desmond Mason.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.428571429&quot;&gt;“I am very honored to open this beautiful gallery. It is always a little nerve-wracking for me to put some of my personal pieces on public display, but the way they look in this space is incredible.” Mason said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is one of the nicest galleries I’ve ever seen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.428571429&quot;&gt;“As a leader of arts programming in Oklahoma City, OCCC values the opportunity to bring in art shows, musical and theatrical productions, surround-sound film screenings, and other live performances to the area, which has until now lacked a venue of similar size and capacity,” President Sechrist concluded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For more information about the OCCC Visual and Performing Arts Center Theater, or for information about the 2014-15 Performing Arts Series lineup, please call (405) 682-7295, or visit www.occc.edu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Oklahoma City Community College Opens Long-awaited Visual and Performing Arts Center Theater&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;From the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NICOLE HURD, College Advising Corps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;The national average ratio of guidance counselors to public high school students is 1 to 471; in California, it’s 1 to 1,000. Compounding the issue, counselors in modest and poor districts are evaluated based on whether their students finish high school, not whether they apply to and succeed in college. And, of course, wealthy districts have more advisers than poor ones, which means that the kids who could use the most help are getting the least. Hurd founded the College Advising Corps to address the problem. A national service organization, the CAC recruits recent college graduates and deploys them to high schools with high numbers of low-income students. Think Teach for America, but for counseling—and with some important differences. CAC advisers overwhelmingly resemble the students they help: 66 percent are underrepresented minorities, 62 percent were eligible for Pell Grants in college, and 54 percent were the first in their families to go to college. They’re not taking anyone’s job: they’re on the payroll of the university they graduated from, with their salaries coming half from the university and half from a mix of philanthropic and public sources. The goal is to work with teachers, counselors, and principals to create a culture in which kids expect to go to college. Hurd recalls getting a call from a principal gushing about a CAC adviser. The adviser had found that many of her students refused to engage with the admissions process because they didn’t know anyone who’d ever gone to college. So she convinced the school’s teachers to put signs on their classroom doors showing not only their name, but also their alma mater—a small but meaningful way to make students realize that they were surrounded by people who had gone to college. The CAC can point to more concrete results, too. Over the past two years, college enrollment rates in its New York City partner schools have gone up by 35 percent. But Hurd knows the organization can’t single-handedly solve the college-advising crisis. “That’s not going to happen without public investment,” she says. “Part of our goal is to execute with excellence and keep proving to everybody that this works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAN PORTERFIELD, Franklin &amp;amp; Marshall College&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;Can a selective liberal arts college triple its share of low-income students in a few years without sacrificing academic quality? The example of Franklin &amp;amp; Marshall suggests that the answer is yes. Since Porterfield became president in 2011, Pell-eligible students have gone from 5 percent of the student body to 19 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;That’s one result of the ambitious Next Generation Initiative, a multipronged effort to boost Franklin &amp;amp; Marshall’s socioeconomic, racial, and geographic diversity. The college has eliminated so-called merit aid, which overwhelmingly goes to students who can afford tuition, and doubled its spending on need-based aid. It hosts a three-week summer prep program for high-achieving, low-income high school seniors from urban charter networks and rural Pennsylvania schools. And each year the school accepts two ten-student cohorts from the Posse Foundation, a nonprofit focused on college access. Porterfield is especially proud that these students are actually improving the academic environment. First-generation students and Pell Grant recipients have the same average grades as the overall student body, and students who get need-based aid are graduating at a higher rate, with higher GPAs, than the school as a whole. The college says it has gotten more selective, not less, since it started the initiative. To Porterfield, that makes it an obvious win-win. “I wish I could tell you that I was facing competition from ten other top schools,” he says. “But the reality is, these students are under-recruited.” Once on campus, they raise the bar for everyone. “Education is one endeavor where everybody wins if you give low-income kids an opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

What he saw concerned him. In his part of the state — a predominantly rural region where the median household income is less than the national average — there was a striking lack of AP depth and success. Building on his previous experience as a K–12 district superintendent, Gilchrist galvanized neighboring district leaders and began to build an AP movement in northeastern North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the leadership of Gilchrist and College Board’s Jenny Krugman, vice president of strategic advocacy and outreach, ECSU, and the College Board regional team put together the ECSU Plan of Action for Advanced Placement and jointly provided resources to host several convenings and professional development sessions for teachers, administrators, AP Coordinators, and other stakeholders. Their ultimate goal focuses not only on expanding access to AP for students in the region but also on informing all stakeholders, including parents, teachers, school officials, city government officials, and business leaders, that expanding AP is an investment in the economic stability of region as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spring 2013, the team conducted a five-hour “advanced academics for all students” session for superintendents and their staff from over 20 local districts. During the session, College Board staff shared the philosophy behind AP, including the challenges and benefits for students and their families, and provided in-depth information on AP Potential™ and PSAT/NMSQT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;. Following this session, the district leaders invited their teachers and curriculum coordinators to attend a one-and-a-half-day convening on ECSU’s campus later that summer. ECSU provided housing, food, recreation, and meeting space. The College Board developed sessions and AP resources tailored specifically for this group. Except for travel, participants attended this comprehensive workshop free of cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the workshop, regional College Board staff continue to hold webinars and conduct direct communication with participants to provide updates, hone-in on specific areas of interest, and discuss next steps. 2013 AP participation data will be used as a baseline to track AP participation and score results through 2016 to measure the success of the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ncpta.org/index.php/2013/07/22/nc-budget-education-highlights/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;North Carolina AP Partnership&lt;/a&gt; — an effort to build a pervasive culture of AP throughout the state — takes shape, the work of the northeastern region will be transitioned into this larger effort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College Board Trustee Leads Local Push to Expand AP® in Northeastern North Carolina&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;h2&gt;Labor of Love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by Matt Connelly, &lt;em&gt;Washington Monthly &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve hours before Paul Quinn College’s biggest day of the summer, president Michael Sorrell is meeting with his staff. There’s a lot to discuss. A fund-raiser for the school’s on-campus farm is scheduled for tomorrow, and after that, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra is playing a free outdoor concert on the lawn outside the chapel. These are two of the most high-profile events of the year for this 450-student historically black institution located off Interstate 45 in a working-class African American neighborhood of South Dallas. But Sorrell isn’t talking about any of that right now. He’s focused on how Vincent is doing at J. C. Penney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vincent Owoseni, a junior finance major from Brooklyn, is interning at the Texas-based department store chain as part of Paul Quinn’s work program, in which all students hold jobs on or off campus to help defray the cost of their education. But, Sorrell tells the room, Owoseni was having some trouble adjusting to the position—he was placed in the shipping department, which he wasn’t prepared for. Sorrell seems conflicted about the news. On the one hand, he tells his staff that Vincent needs to understand that unexpected assignments are part of any career and that he’ll learn just as much from the logistics side of J. C. Penney as from the customer-facing side. On the other hand, he treats the news as a possible warning sign. “He’s one of the best students we’ve got here,” Sorrell says. “If he’s having trouble, how is everyone else doing?” He assigns staffers to check in on other students who might be in similar situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I later catch up with Owoseni, he expresses no surprise that his name came up in the meeting. Sorrell, he says, has been in touch throughout the internship. Indeed, he’d been reaching out to him since high school. Owoseni was valedictorian at City Polytechnic High School, and Sorrell flew out to meet him. “He was very inspiring,” Owoseni says. “He asked what I wanted to do. Then he told me, ‘You can do better than that.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Better than that” is a fair description of Sorrell’s own aspirational leadership philosophy, and of the school’s trajectory since he took over as president in 2007. He arrived to find a college that was on the verge of closing its doors, buried under a mountain of debt with more than a dozen abandoned buildings and a four-year graduation rate of 1 percent. It seemed less “fixer-upper” than “lost cause.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrell went to work right away. He axed the expensive football program and turned the playing field into a farm, where students can work and from which food gets donated to the surrounding neighborhood. He traveled the country, visiting other colleges to learn from their presidents, and building up recruiting relationships with high schools. He nearly doubled the size of the student body, and raised millions from donors and corporate partners, enough to put (and keep) the school in the black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stunning turnaround of Paul Quinn has made Sorrell into a mini-celebrity. He’s been interviewed on HBO, spoken at the Aspen Ideas Festival, and participated in countless higher education panels. But what he is increasingly getting attention for is the work program, which he first rolled out in 2015. All students are required to work at least eight hours a week, first on campus for the college, then off campus for participating employers. Twenty-four hundred dollars of students’ wages per year go to offsetting their tuition, the rest goes into their pockets. This has allowed Paul Quinn to slash its total cost of attendance from $23,800 to $14,275 a year. Sorrell’s goal is to get students into the job market with less than $10,000 in debt; the average student takes on only $2,300 in loans a year after Pell Grants and other subsidies along with work tuition credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that students of modest means can contribute some of their labor in exchange for lower tuition is not new. Some Catholic high schools and a few rural liberal arts colleges have long operated that way. But Sorrell is the first to apply the model in an urban college setting. He is also the first to extend the concept beyond low-skill on-campus jobs to off-campus positions with private-sector employers, where students can garner skills and connections that might give them a leg up in the post-college job market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “New Urban College Model,” as Sorrell calls it, addresses some of the most pressing problems in higher education: how to substantially reduce tuition for lower-income, and especially minority, students in a way that colleges can afford; how to do so for students who need the high-touch support of a liberal arts college and who might otherwise get lost in a larger public university; and how to better integrate a liberal arts education with the job market. (Sorrell thinks his model can achieve even more—that reinventing the urban campus can also bring back depressed urban neighborhoods.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no wonder that Sorrell’s innovations are a hot topic in higher ed reform circles. The question is whether those interventions are, in wonk-speak, “replicable.” In other words, can other schools achieve what Paul Quinn College has without a one-in-a-million leader like Michael Sorrell?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of colleges these days, Paul Quinn offers a “summer bridge” program, in which incoming students spend six weeks getting acclimated to college life in general and to Paul Quinn in particular by living in dorms and taking a few introductory classes. Unlike at other colleges, the president of Paul Quinn teaches one. “What’s on your mind?” asks Sorrell at the beginning of one such class this past summer. Only two weeks into their pre-college experience, the assembled students aren’t afraid to share. They end up discussing the then-recent nightclub shooting in Orlando, touching on religion, gun control, and gay rights over the course of twenty minutes, leading into Sorrell’s actual lesson plan about what makes a community. The conversation isn’t purely free-form; when a student is called on, she must first stand up and announce her name loudly to the class. Any drops in volume, grammatical errors, or uses of the dreaded filler word “like” will get called out by Sorrell. “He’s intense and kinda tortures students when he’s teaching them,” says junior Elexis Evans, one of his TAs, before quickly adding, “But he’s a great professor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrell is six foot four, with an athlete’s physique, and he holds court with the confidence of someone who doesn’t mind reminding you that he was a star basketball player at Oberlin College. But even in his toughness he exudes empathy, recognizing which students he can needle and poke fun at and which ones need more positive reinforcement to get their confidence up. When the community lesson turns to crime and punishment—specifically marijuana legalization—he poses a question: “Hypothetically, how many of you have been in the vicinity of something illegal, like getting high?” About two dozen hands go up—which is about two dozen more than you’d expect from a bunch of soon-to-be college freshmen facing down the president of their Christian school. He laughs and gestures at those with their hands down. “Now, I know some of you are lying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrell says he pushes students over the summer to prepare them for college, but offers enough support that they understand it’s constructive. “You can’t allow them to not be educated, but you have to create a safe space,” he says. “I spend a lot of time affirming my students. You’re safe, I love you, I’m here with you for the long haul.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that safe space can mean the occasional questioning of the professor. When he chides a student for starting her sentence with “I feel like,” classmates protest in her defense, arguing that it’s proper usage and not a filler. Sorrell argues that it’s not incorrect but rather “substandard,” in an attempt to quell the semantic mutiny as students break out their phones to check dictionary apps and weigh in. They’re eager to prove themselves; in many cases, it’s why they were recruited to Paul Quinn in the first place. About eight in ten students are getting Pell Grants, and more than 70 percent will get no money from their families to help pay for tuition. Two-thirds of them hail from outside Texas, with high numbers coming from cities like Detroit, Chicago, and New York. Some have faced massive roadblocks in their path to college—extreme poverty, broken homes, multiple deaths in the family—and nearly all will have to work harder than they ever have before to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That includes little things like basic time management and academic skills, especially in preparation for the jobs to come. Many have never paid attention for an entire multi-hour lecture before, have never really written a paper, have nothing but anxiety at the prospect of tests that can make or break a grade. To foster a sense of professionalism, Sorrell enforces a business-casual dress code in classes. For those who don’t have the clothes, the school keeps a closet full of donated businesswear that students can borrow from. Those who struggle despite the staff’s hands-on approach can be put on the “Carrington plan”—they live together on the one dormitory’s third floor and maintain a schedule of distraction-free study hall sessions. The program is named after former undergraduate Ryan Carrington, a promising student whom Sorrell ordered to work at a desk in his own office after a massive drop in grades following a fraternity pledge. Sorrell took Carrington’s keys and cell phone and had him introduce himself to every visitor who came in. “He had never sat still long enough to learn,” Sorrell says. Sure enough, the grades went back up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrell (and the high school administrators who like to send him names) makes a point to find students like Carrington who can blossom with that extra push that Paul Quinn can provide, who have been dealt a difficult hand but have the potential to thrive in a college that’s meant to feel like a family. “There is this entrepreneurial spirit,” Evans says. “A lot of us didn’t realize we came here with that, but we had it brought out of us.” They may use “like” incorrectly at first, but they’re willing to fight for themselves when they get it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Sorrell gets the class back on track following the great “like” debate, Trezuer Butler smirks at the scene. Butler came to the summer bridge program as an incoming freshman last year, taking her first-ever flight out of her native San Francisco. Now she’s a TA at the same bridge program, her work helping offset her tuition. Like many Paul Quinn students, the urban work college model wasn’t totally new to her—she came from a work high school, Immaculate Conception Academy, where the administrators have a relationship with Sorrell. She knew she wanted to go to a historically black school, and ended up getting in everywhere she wanted to go. She picked Paul Quinn after receiving a full scholarship, and Sorrell surprised her with a call after she accepted and convinced her to come to Dallas early for the summer program. Afterward, he stopped in San Francisco for Sunday dinner with her family, who were nervous about sending her off to Texas for good. “He got permission to watch me, punish me, motivate me,” Butler said. “I didn’t have a relationship with my dad, so he really stepped in and stepped up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s remarkable about these calls and visits is how unremarkable they seem as part of his larger recruitment strategy. It’s not uncommon for Sorrell and his staff to be on a first-name basis with students who are still in high school. The school estimates that only 10 percent of incoming freshmen aren’t recruited in some way by Paul Quinn. That closeness doesn’t end when they get to campus. “I firmly believe that you meet students where they are, and you love them, and you lift them,” Sorrell says. “I believe in authentic relationships.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrell says he needs to put extra work into building trust with students because his background isn’t the same as many of theirs. He grew up upper middle class in Chicago, where his father owned a barbecue restaurant and his mother ran a social work agency, and he attended St. Ignatius College Prep, one of the best schools in the city. He got an offer to play basketball at Oberlin, but took a recruiting visit and hated it. “It really was an uncomfortable place,” he says. “People protest everything, they question everything. I wasn’t a social outlier, so I became the outlier.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, the decision wasn’t really up to him. Sorrell’s mother decided that choosing a college was too important to leave to a teenager and forged his signature on the Oberlin commitment. He was livid. That’s illegal, he told her. He could sue! “You’re gonna sue your mother for sending you to one of the best schools in the country?” she replied. “We’ll see how that goes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute never made it to court. Sorrell went off to Oberlin and, as expected, felt like a fish out of water, a Chicago jock among the hippies. But he found his place—thirty years later he’s on the cover of the latest alumni magazine and is still the basketball team’s fifth all-time leading scorer. One moment in particular from his undergrad days sticks out as a sign of things to come. A friend pulled him into a dinner with Johnnetta Cole, then president of Spelman College. He agreed because, hey, free food. But then he started talking to Cole. “She was the coolest president I’ve ever met,” he says. “I told myself, This is what college presidents can be like? Sign me up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That job wouldn’t come until much later, though. After Oberlin, Sorrell got his master’s degree in public policy from Duke. He liked it so much he stuck around for law school. But while he had always figured he would end up as a civil rights attorney, the notion seemed less and less appealing as time went on. “I began to realize the struggle was no longer in the courts,” he says. He got his JD, but set his sights on business school. Once again, Mom stepped in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She gave me the Peter Pan speech,” he says. It was time to leave academic Neverland to grow up and get a real job. (Little did she know.) So in 1994 Sorrell moved to Dallas to work for a law firm. He then spent two years in the Clinton White House working as a special assistant on the president’s race initiative. (He told the &lt;em&gt;Dallas Morning News&lt;/em&gt; that he was “way down the food chain” in the White House, but he evidently made enough of an impression that, this past summer, he was able to lure the former president to speak at Paul Quinn.) After his sojourn in Washington, he returned to Dallas, where he spent the next decade practicing law and doing public affairs consulting, including working on Dallas’s 2012 Olympic bid. Understandably, he took a special interest in sports, representing NBA players and even helping former college players heading into the NBA draft to create political-style campaigns to up their stock. His connections paid off with an offer to join a group that wanted to buy the NBA’s Memphis Grizzlies; he would have been franchise president and gotten a small ownership stake. He was driving to scout then University of Texas phenom (and future Oklahoma City defector) Kevin Durant when the people at Paul Quinn gave him a call. How would he like to be president of the college?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he’s fond of saying, when you get offered a job you didn’t apply for, that’s probably a good sign no one else wants it. Paul Quinn was on the verge of bankruptcy, of de-accreditation, of closing down for good. Why hitch yourself to that wagon when you’re about to be an NBA executive? As it turns out, there are two reasons: Michael Sorrell likes a challenge, and he wasn’t about to be an NBA executive. He agreed to take over for ninety days while the board looked for a permanent president. When the Grizzlies deal didn’t work out, he became that permanent president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even outside of the financial and enrollment struggles, things were bleak those first few years. In addition to the massive deficits and threats of de-accreditation, the campus had fifteen abandoned buildings, and the ones that were occupied were in terrible shape. Anyone could wander onto campus, and often did (faculty members were afraid to leave their purses behind them in classrooms for fear that they’d be snatched). With 140 acres of Great Trinity Forest to the north and east, the unwelcome visitors weren’t always human. Sorrell remembers driving a local politician around campus about six months into his presidency when they saw what seemed like a big dog roaming the grounds. “That’s not a dog,” Sorrell says he realized as they got a closer look. “That’s a bobcat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Sorrell reckons the bobcats were pushed out by coyotes, which have since been replaced by stray dogs. After a southern Dallas woman was killed by a pack of dogs in May, Sorrell’s summer bridge class’s big project this year was developing proposals for dealing with the neighborhood’s stray dog problem.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrell surrounded the campus with a fence and stationed security guards at the front to keep out strangers (and bobcats). Thanks to a million-dollar donation, he was able to get all fifteen abandoned buildings torn down, exorcising the campus’s most visible past demons. He began creating pipelines to bring in students who could meet his more rigorous standards. It was a pace of work that could give you a heart attack. A year and a half after he took over, that’s exactly what happened. Sorrell’s heart stopped overnight, and he was unconscious for nearly three days before coming to in the hospital. The experience only deepened his resolve. “I just remember thinking, we’re going to win,” he says. “I am a man of deep faith. And I don’t think the Lord saves you to humiliate you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrell dove into studying what other college presidents were doing. “When I started as president, I didn’t know anything,” he says. “And I hate not knowing anything. So I immersed myself in my craft.” He read and reread Loren Pope’s &lt;em&gt;Colleges That Change Lives&lt;/em&gt; and traveled the country visiting campuses, from nearby Prairie View A&amp;amp;M to far-flung Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington. His biggest breakthrough didn’t come from a college visit, though, but a high school one. On a recruiting trip to Detroit Cristo Rey, Sorrell was wowed by the Catholic school’s corporate work-study program, in which students work once a week at local businesses. It was an idea ripe for expanding on the college level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He spent the next year studying rural work schools like Berea College in Kentucky. A tuition-free institution founded by Christian abolitionists, Berea ranks number one on the&lt;em&gt;Washington Monthly&lt;/em&gt;’s 2016 liberal arts colleges and Best Bang for the Buck lists. Admirable as it is, however, only seven rural colleges run on the work model, even though the idea has been around for a century. “The reason work colleges didn’t really take hold is partly because the work is drudgery,” Sorrell says. That’s because rural areas have few local employers where students can be placed in interesting, cutting-edge jobs. “In urban areas you can absolutely connect the work to what people are studying.” It was that insight that Sorrell brought to his board and students. Getting students real professional experience while lowering tuition costs was enticing enough on all sides to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far the new model has brought vast improvements in student outcomes, Sorrell says, though it will take a few more years for the statistics to catch up. While he increased the school’s official six-year graduation rate from 1 percent for students starting in 2006 to 13 percent for those who started in 2009, the latest figure comes right on the heels of Paul Quinn’s most turbulent period, in which hundreds of students left because of the shuttering of the football team, a disciplinary and academic crackdown, and lingering accreditation concerns. (The&lt;em&gt;Washington Monthly&lt;/em&gt;’s current rankings only include an average of the graduation rates of the 2006, 2007, and 2008 cohorts.) The percentage of students who return after freshman year has since jumped from 33 percent at its low point to between 65 percent and 72 percent over the past few years, and Sorrell expects the graduation rates to follow. “The lagging indicators still measure the school that we were seven, eight, nine years ago,” he says. “We’re not that school anymore. When that graduation rate jumps, people are going to have whiplash.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrell expects that the work curriculum will only help retention. The We Over Me Farm, still Sorrell’s signature move as president, is the keystone of his model. While at first it may seem like another example of work college “drudgery,” students don’t only labor on the farm—they also work on the marketing and business sides, helping to solicit donations and make sales. While some of the produce is used in the dining halls, much of it is sold to Dallas restaurants and grocery stores along with larger corporate buyers like the Dallas Cowboys. And at least 10 percent of the produce every year is donated to charities in the school’s Highland Hills neighborhood, which sits in the middle of a food desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where Sorrell’s plan to “end urban poverty” comes in. The work college model goes hand in hand with his idea of small urban colleges as “anchor institutions”; even a small school provides economic investment, employment opportunities, and cultural resources in inner-city neighborhoods. Thanks in large part to the success of the farm, for instance, a new grocery store is opening up across the street. Paul Quinn students organized to successfully fight off a city plan to significantly expand a nearby landfill farther into Highland Hills. Students marched multiple times, wearing “I AM NOT TRASH” T-shirts, and eventually Dallas relented and threw away the landfill plan. Now Sorrell is lobbying city officials for a light-rail stop in the neighborhood, which would serve his students (who often have to take difficult bus routes or drive to their jobs around the region) as well as Highland Hills commuters. And while Paul Quinn may be gated, it can still provide an artistic as well as economic impact: in addition to lectures and symposiums that are open to the public, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra plays a free show on campus every year, which Sorrell calls his favorite event the school puts on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrell got his doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania last year using the New Urban College Model as his dissertation. In it, he argues that his model can be copied across the country. There are 1,725 four-year colleges in U.S. principal cities, and about 70 percent have fewer than 5,000 students. “This model was built to be replicated,” he says. “I’m worried about what happens if it doesn’t catch on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is, can the model catch on without such a charismatic figure leading the charge? Sorrell has an astounding ability to command the room no matter who’s in it. He can banter with students, run a staff meeting, talk with education policy wonks, chat up church leaders, and network with big donors locally and around the country. Education reform is full of examples of brave new ideas that flourished under their innovator but faltered when tried elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrell counters that there are many different types of college presidents, and that his model can work with different kinds of leaders—though there’s one quality they need. “It’s replicable, but you need a champion,” he says. “You don’t necessarily need Michael Sorrell, but you need a champion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Quinn College, of course, is lucky enough to have both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day of the farm fund-raiser and the symphony concert, Sorrell is in the library trying to figure out exactly what he wants his message to be. Paul Quinn staff and students are writing words of inspiration on their bodies and getting photographed, the results of which will be posted around campus and used in the school’s new marketing campaign. Butler, Evans, and other students are writing, erasing, and rewriting slogans and hashtags on Sorrell’s arms in a flurry of markers and baby wipes. He has always been the face of Paul Quinn, but today he’s going to have to be the biceps, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he poses for the photo, the students heckle from the sidelines. “We don’t want to be scared of our president!” Evans yells as Sorrell tries on a tough look. Later, at the concert, they’ll unsuccessfully lobby him to buy them dessert from one of the food trucks parked nearby. “We want some ice cream! Come on, do your fatherly duties!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ice cream aside, Sorrell’s fatherly duties—checking in on students before they even arrive on campus, meeting their families, looking after them on campus—may be his greatest gift to Paul Quinn. But his New Urban College Model could be his gift to the rest of the country. A system that keeps tuition low while allowing students to get real professional experience in preparation for entering the job market would be a godsend for small city schools that often struggle to do either of those. Paul Quinn College, no longer the underdog, is showing the rest of them how it’s done. Bringing the model to cities across the country and ending urban poverty might be farther down the line, but for now Sorrell still has to take it one student at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the concert, as students, staff, and community members are lining up to say goodbye to Sorrell, a boy pulls him aside. Robert, a high school sophomore who came all the way up from Houston, wants to tell him how much he likes Paul Quinn. They exchange email addresses, and Sorrell makes him promise to send him a note when he gets home. “You have it in you to do really, really well,” Sorrell tells him. “Your grades will matter. Drown out all the background noise. The lights come on, the teacher’s in front of you. Give it all you’ve got.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Members in the News: Trustee Michael Sorrell and His “Labor of Love” &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The Academic Assembly is charged with considering issues and actions related to providing universal access to high standards of learning. During the AAC’s most recent meeting, the council discussed several important issues and programmatic developments, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The role of professional development at the College Board&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The development of a high-quality, innovative program at the College Board that supports rigorous instructional opportunities for students in grades 6–12&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communications around the redesigned SAT&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Member engagement and delegate outreach&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The council also discussed possible speakers, discussion points, and session topics for College Board Forum 2014. Pam Paulson and Michael McDonough, chair and chair-elect of the AAC, discuss the work of the council below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;College Board All Access (CBAA)&lt;/strong&gt;: What are the top priorities of the Academic Assembly and how do they reflect major issues affecting academic professionals right now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pam Paulson (PP):&lt;/strong&gt; The top issues span a large range because education is a complex system that is connected or disconnected across the country, across grades pre-K–16, across disciplines, and even involving partnerships with outside institutions. If this enterprise wants our country to thrive and continue to innovate, all of our students must succeed and have the ability to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We must be concerned with both the students who are struggling and the students who are doing well. Both groups need to have the right amount of challenge and support to continue growing. Teachers are tasked with the enormous responsibility of educating all students in preparation for being contributing citizens who lead productive, fulfilled lives. This makes teacher preparation and professional development central issues in the education system. High-quality instruction that meets students’ needs leads to successful learners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to understand student academic performance and growth is to gather information from external measures of student achievement. The College Board offers high-quality tests and courses like SAT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and AP&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; that give students a sense of how they are doing on rigorous exams at a point in time. Academic achievement also includes continuous improvement so that students learn how to improve their work along the way — getting feedback to understand what they know and what they still need to learn. Feedback from their teacher, from experts in the field, from peers, even from self-assessments of their work can help students reflect and refine their thinking and skill development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is one reason the College Board is developing the AP Capstone™ program and diploma — to give students another way to learn from assessments and demonstrate their achievements. The Capstone project uses multiple forms of ongoing data to help students better understand their level of accomplishment and need. Students need to be inspired to do their best, and information about their progress is a key component of keeping them engaged in their own learning and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CBAA: &lt;/strong&gt;Talk about some key takeaways from the council meeting. Were there any surprises throughout the discussions? Any topics that were particularly divisive among council members?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael McDonough (MM):&lt;/strong&gt; At the most recent council meeting, members identified and discussed a number of engaging and timely topics. There was a dynamic conversation regarding how to better collaborate with members, especially during program redesign and draft assessments. Although much of this conversation focused on AP assessments, members were clear to identify other opportunities for enhanced collaboration and partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members also discussed the College Board’s significant capacity to report on a wide range of student data points. Members reviewed some initial data regarding community college retention, transfer, and completion, insisting that more focused analysis is needed, and that our language in framing and reporting this data not privilege one sector over another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the other wide-ranging discussions, four themes or topics seemed to emerge: the passionate support for access and equity; the strong advocacy for professional development opportunities at all levels; the sustained focus on supporting academic rigor; and the building interest in designing robust and transparent pathways for students as they transition into high school, college, or career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CBAA:&lt;/strong&gt; Are there any new topics on the horizon that committee members can expect to see on the agenda for the next meeting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PP&lt;/strong&gt;: As the Academic Council council, we are involved in gathering information to provide insights and advice as the College Board develops new academic initiatives or refines existing programs. Our involvement often is in an inquiry format as we ask questions meant to stimulate thinking about what is possible, what might be challenging when the programs actually get into schools, and what might be unforeseen issues. One area we know will capture our attention is diversity as we spend time asking how we can reach and teach all students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MM: &lt;/strong&gt;Assembly members are hoping to see more presentations and vigorous conversation regarding data analysis, especially related to the community college sector and to student success; to hear more about the emerging initiative in career technical education, and to help shape a more collaborative culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PP: &lt;/strong&gt;The future of this country and the world is dependent on an educated population. We cannot afford to educate only some of our students. In order to continue creating and making innovative products and services, we need to tap into the interests and talents of each student. This means we are interested in a broad range of opportunities for students to find their strengths and passions and consider their possibilities. Each of the disciplines brings something to the education of our students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By bringing together subject-area experts and regional leaders at council meetings, we can spend time thinking about how the interaction and combination of academic disciplines in the education system makes for an even more powerful education for our students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Academic Assembly Council Focuses on Instruction and Professional Development During Recent Meeting&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I have spent the last six years as the chancellor of the public schools of the District of Columbia and the last decade working for the school district. For 20 years, I have been focused on improving educational outcomes for students in the nation’s capital. As I conclude my time as a district leader, I see enormous promise in the future of education, and I am very optimistic about what we can do to help students in traditional school districts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my time at the school system, we showed it is possible to make dramatic improvements in only a few years. We improved student performance, increased enrollment, increased student satisfaction, expanded our graduation rate, and improved college access for all students. This success didn’t come easily, but the lessons we learned can be applied to any other school district. In fact, they must be, because we owe it to the more than 90 percent of students in this country who attend public schools to create great opportunities for a bright future.&lt;/p&gt;

Although college-going rates are rising among American students, college &lt;em&gt;graduation&lt;/em&gt; rates are “among the lowest in the developed world,” according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report features a case study on Franklin &amp;amp; Marshall College (F&amp;amp;M), and acknowledges Dan Porterfield, F&amp;amp;M president and College Board Trustee, and his work to promote these operating principles on campus. Through relationship building with K–12 and community organizations, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79HNxpQFmhE&quot;&gt;F&amp;amp;M College Prep&lt;/a&gt;, a program that brings high-achieving first-generation students to campus for three weeks the summer before their senior year, the number of Pell Grant recipients enrolled at F&amp;amp;M has tripled in just three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tough Love&lt;/em&gt; calls on the federal government to leverage student loan and tax benefit resources to establish protocols and oversight that will protect students and create consequences for chronically underperforming schools. The report also encourages elite institutions to expand access for Pell grant recipients and underrepresented students.&lt;/p&gt;

Fleisher is currently the president of the National Math and Science Initiative (NMSI), a nonprofit dedicated to improving students’ STEM performance. In this role, he provides strategic direction for NMSI’s programs and serves as a liaison to school district leaders, state and national STEM education partners, and funders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Access (AA): What’s the most critical issue in education today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregg Fleisher (GF):  Low expectations for students from a low socio-economic background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: What do you value most about your role on the Board of Trustees?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GF: It’s twofold: First, being able to understand the inner-workings of the College Board so that I may represent the great work that the organization is doing, accurately and enthusiastically. And second, I believe my experience in education is unique, and I love that I have a voice with respect to the critical issues that the College Board is facing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: How does your relationship with the College Board enhance your role at the NMSI? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GF: Since we promote being successful in Advanced Placement as the key driver to college matriculation and college graduation, being closely aligned with the College Board is critical. When school districts ask us about the latest studies that show the efficacy of AP, I’m plugged in. Additionally, when school districts want to know reasonable expectations they should have of their students, the data agreement we have with the College Board allows us to understand what is ambitious and attainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: How did your own path influence your career choice?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GF: I had always wanted to be a high school math teacher, but the pressures from my peers when I was young led me to start my career as an actuary. After a few years in the actuarial world, I knew I had to do what I was “called” to do, and I became a high school math teacher. My success as an AP Calculus teacher opened up opportunities for me first in Dallas, and then across Texas. That, in turn, allowed me to start a nonprofit that increases the number of students succeeding in AP math, science, and English classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: What are you most looking forward to in 2017?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GF: Being a positive role model for my kids—one that exhibits hard work and honesty with a servant’s heart. And I mean a role model not only for my own children, but also for all the students we serve. I think it’s vital to have leaders demonstrate honesty, hard work, and a willingness to serve others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: Can you share a fun fact with us? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GF: I was the original architect of AP Potential back in 1996. I created it to convince the community that someone who they thought was not a very good teacher was actually a great teacher; she got better AP scores from students with the same PSAT scores than any other teacher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;An Interview with Trustee Gregg Fleisher&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

He then announced a new board chair. &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2014/11/christiansen-college-board/&quot;&gt;Douglas L. Christiansen&lt;/a&gt;, vice provost for university enrollment affairs, dean of admissions and financial aid and associate professor of public policy and higher education and accepted his nomination as chair of the College Board’s Board of Trustees, and gave remarks about the exciting precipice on which the organization stands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “There is a feeling of excitement among attendees this year,” said Christiansen. “It’s palpable, and it is because the College Board is truly taking action to deliver opportunities to students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christiansen cited significant organization-wide initiatives that are driving this action, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;assessment redesign&lt;/a&gt; and the College Board’s partnership with Khan Academy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christiansen’s vision is in keeping with the College Board’s four key tenets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare &lt;/strong&gt;students for success through access to high-quality instruction and assessment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Propel &lt;/strong&gt;students toward college and career by working to simplify the college planning process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reach&lt;/strong&gt; higher by providing high-quality programs and services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thrive &lt;/strong&gt;as an organization by strengthening relationships, services, and communication to better serve the needs of students.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These core principles are the force behind the forward momentum within the College Board that will be the hallmark of Christiansen’s chairmanship. In addition to the assessment redesign and the exciting new partnerships and programs that are on the horizon, Christiansen stressed the importance of the College Board’s members and their support for these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Each of you is critical to the College Board’s mission,” said Christiansen as he addressed the membership. “Board members, community members, staff, and leadership must all work together as a team to further the mission and take the College Board to the next level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Vanderbilt’s chief enrollment strategist, Christiansen oversees several offices and programs. He is an expert on issues of enrollment management, domestic and international admissions, access and equity, and revenue generation funding models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christiansen’s College Board resumé is long and robust, making him extremely qualified to lead the Board of Trustees into the next phase of delivering opportunities to students. He has served on the Board of Trustees since 2011, and last year was chair of the Finance Committee, on which he served for three years. Prior to being a Trustee, Christiansen served on the College Board’s Task Force on Admissions in the 21st Century, the Advanced Placement&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; National Higher Education Advisory Council, the Trustee-appointed Membership Committee, and the National Colloquium Planning Committee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Douglas L.

&lt;p&gt;The new measures, which will be implemented in close partnership with the College Board’s members, constitute the most robust and direct actions taken by a college entrance exam provider against test takers seeking an unfair advantage on the test and companies and actors who assist them for their own profit or benefit. While the growing influence of organizations that steal and sell test content to students has been concentrated in a few international locations in recent years, the solutions to preserve the integrity of SAT scores must be implemented globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of the new SAT last year, the College Board has increased test form development to reduce reuse, strengthened prevention and detection techniques, and bolstered efforts to identify and pursue those sharing copyright-protected test content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are unwavering in our commitment to SAT test security and we will continue to confront any efforts to undermine it, including the unauthorized disclosure of test questions and test forms,” said Peter Schwartz, Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel at the College Board. “There are three fundamental ways we protect the value of the SAT for test takers and score recipients: increasing the pool of test items, increasing security and deterrence, and limiting exposure of test materials by reducing the number of administrations. In all of our efforts, we’ve worked to strike a balance between thwarting those seeking an unfair advantage and providing testing opportunities for the vast majority of students who play by the rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New measures announced today further increase security and preserve the integrity of SAT scores. They include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reducing the international testing dates for the SAT to four for the 2017-18 and 2018-19 school years, with administrations in October, December, March, and May. Recognizing that international students use both the SAT and SAT Subject Tests to build competitive applications, SAT Subject Tests will be available in October, November, December, May, and June.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Canceling the June 2017 international SAT administration, as part of the change to the international test administration schedule. SAT Subject Tests will be available during the June 2017 administration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Providing the names of test prep companies and individuals we suspect of stealing and receiving secure test content to law enforcement and other government agencies in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prohibiting individuals from taking the SAT, SAT Subject Tests, and Advanced Placement Exams when we conclude they have gained or attempted to gain or share an unfair advantage on any College Board test.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exploring with both colleges and high schools effective ways to share with them – consistent with applicable laws and contractual obligations – whether their applicants or attending students, respectively, have gained or attempted to gain or share an unfair advantage on any College Board test.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increasing test center audits worldwide.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Making it easier for students and educators to confidentially and anonymously report suspected cheating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expanding the College Board&#039;s criteria for barring registrants who are taking the SAT for other than one of its intended purposes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With these new policies, the College Board is committed to expose and thwart individuals and organizations who attempt to steal and share test materials for profit or other gain,” said Jeremiah Quinlan, Dean of Undergraduate Admissions at Yale University. “My colleagues and I will continue to seek further means to protect the integrity of test administrations so that honest test-takers throughout the world can freely pursue their educational aspirations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The College Board has been very mindful of the dual obligations to both confront bad actors and to ensure that students who play by the rules can pursue their lifelong dreams,” said Zina L. Evans, Vice President for Enrollment Management at the University of Florida. “This firm stance sends a clear signal that individuals or organizations attempting to steal and share test materials for their own profit and benefit will not be tolerated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The College Board is taking new, bold action at the urging of our Board of Trustees and in consultation with colleagues in higher education,” said James Montoya, Chief of Membership, Governance, and Global Higher Education at the College Board. “We will continue to consult with educators and will take great care in implementing these actions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policies will be enacted for future administrations. The College Board will provide more details to test takers and educators later this spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a comprehensive investigation and statistical analysis, the College Board also informed a number of students who sat for the January international SAT administration that their scores are being canceled. The scores for an additional set of students are being reviewed as part of ongoing comprehensive investigations. These actions are part of the standard process of ensuring the integrity of each SAT administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new policies announced today build on enhanced security measures the College Board has implemented over the past few years, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased security of test materials prior to and during an exam administration, including delivery and storage procedures, rules for access, and the implementation of secure lockboxes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comprehensive test-day administration protocols including sign-in and photo ID requirements, limiting testing room access, protocols for seating, and procedures for monitoring examinee behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rigorous and innovative statistical analyses to identify invalid scores.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The College Board’s latest innovative approach to address attempts to gain an unfair advantage will help in reflecting students’ real academic standing and achievements when considering their application,” said Cesar Wazen, Director of Scholarships &amp;amp; Partnerships Office, Qatar University. “We thank College Board leadership for standing up for colleges, aspiring students, and their families around the world.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College Board Announces New Measures to Enhance SAT Security Domestically and Abroad&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
