&lt;p&gt;John Barnhill, assistant vice president for enrollment management at Florida State University (FSU), and Jesus Jara, deputy superintendent of Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), joined the College Board’s Aaron Lemon-Strauss to discuss the new SAT, the College Board’s partnership with Khan Academy, and how they are using these tools to accelerate student readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OCPS has been giving its students the opportunity to take the PSAT/NMSQT and SAT during the school day. This past fall, the school district had a “college day” where freshmen took the PSAT 8/9, sophomores and juniors took the PSAT/NMSQT, and seniors took the SAT as a way to eliminate barriers to college for students and foster a college-going culture on campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the launch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;Official SAT Practice&lt;/a&gt; on Khan Academy, OCPS has leveraged the online learning system to promote college readiness and increase access to college. The district’s schools have opened their media centers after school and on Saturdays to allow students to practice on school computers. They’ve also worked with the local YMCA to provide opportunities for their students to practice for the SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our kids in OCPS can be ready to go and have open doors when they go into higher education and their careers,” said Jara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnhill agreed with the importance of the College Board/Khan Academy partnership, calling the tool a game changer. He added that FSU is going to begin a campaign focused on practice that will encourage prospective students to use Official SAT Practice. He believes that using Khan Academy’s practice tool will help students feel ready for college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think [Khan Academy] is going to give them hope,” he told the audience. “We’re calling it practice, but I think it is hope.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Khan Academy Gives Students Hope&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>Southern Regional Forum Closes with Panel of College Admission Officers</title>

The esteemed panel, with a combined 125 years of experience, featured:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Barbara Polk, deputy director of undergraduate admissions, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ingrid Hayes, vice president for enrollment management, Spelman College&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kerr C. Ramsay III, associate vice president for admissions, High Point University&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tim Amyx, director of admissions &amp;amp; registrar, Volunteer State Community College&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are some highlights from their conversation. Remarks have been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What do admissions officers look for during the review process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barbara Polk&lt;/strong&gt;: We want to get to know the students as individuals, as best we can. The tricky or challenging part is when you have to then take their stories, in some cases from various institutions, and put them into a competitive decision process. And that’s hard to do, because if it’s a holistic review, then you don’t just point to a GPA or a test score and say, ‘If you had 10 points higher here, or if you have GPA had been this instead of that…’ It’s the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Should students be worried about referencing personal stories in their essay?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingrid Hayes&lt;/strong&gt;: As long as the information they’re sharing helps us to understand their journey and their passion for what they do, that is absolutely something that they can share. That’s really what’s important—for students to give that extra coloring, to tell us why this thing was important, why that other thing was important, and to share it with the admission committee. We want to understand their stories. We all want to cheer for our students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Is experiential education a good way to get around the idea of mere “credit-counting”? Is it too difficult for students to take on, or for higher ed institutions to implement? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kerr C. Ramsay III&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s our responsibility to go beyond what we think students can do. I think experiential learning helps students get beyond “credit-counting” or just “information.” And I think we all know as educators that when you really understand something, you’re able to then teach it. That’s the best sign that you understand a concept, when you’re able to share it with someone else in a way that they can understand it. Imagine asking an athlete to only practice all the time and never play a game. We would never do that. But we ask our students to do that all the time in academics, and we think that it’s a bit of a faulty mindset. We need to give our students chance to try and apply their learning each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What other higher education options are out there for students?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim Amyx&lt;/strong&gt;: Let me encourage you to learn about the activity at your community colleges nearby. If you really care about your students, then sometimes you have to have the conversation when you say, “You know what? What you’re facing is overwhelming, and you might be better off taking a baby step, but that baby step doesn’t mean that it’s a bad step.” My biggest retention problem is that the students get to the community college and they find out that it’s hard, that we actually have academic rigor. So, if you’re at a four-year school or you’re K-12 counselors, I encourage you to take the time to find out about all of your students’ higher education options. You may find that there’s a hidden gem in your backyard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Southern Regional Forum Closes with Panel of College Admission Officers&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
