  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Congratulations graduates! Completing high school and getting into college are huge achievements, and the summer is a great time to reflect on how far you’ve come. You’ve worked hard, and you’ve earned the right to enjoy yourself a little, but remember that the summer is a great time to get ready for the next big chapter of your life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Here are 10 ideas for making the most of your summer so you can hit the ground running in the fall.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  1. Put your “
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/get-in/making-a-decision/you-made-your-college-choice-whats-next&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    paperwork
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ” in order. Make sure you complete and return all the necessary forms your college sent about orientation, financial aid, housing, meal plans, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  2. Review your school’s course catalog to select classes. If you know your major,&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/find-colleges/academic-life/students-talk-about-college-classes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    choose some courses 
  &lt;/a&gt;
  that fulfill general requirements in that area.
  .
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  3. Don’t be shy about asking for help. Have questions about your&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://studentaid.ed.gov/fafsa/estimate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    financial aid
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ? Contact the financial aid office and they can&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/pay-for-college/financial-aid-101/questions-to-ask-financial-aid-officers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    answer questions
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &amp;nbsp;about topics such as&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/pay-for-college/paying-your-share/what-to-do-when-your-financial-aid-award-isnt-enough&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    receiving additional aid
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &amp;nbsp;and ways to find scholarships to help&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://studentaid.ed.gov/types&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    pay
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &amp;nbsp;for college.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  4. Plan on life beyond the classroom. Explore what extracurricular activities, teams or groups your college offers. Campus events are a great way to have fun and&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/find-colleges/campus-life/my-college-life-outside-the-classroom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    meet people
  &lt;/a&gt;
  .
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  5. Contact your roommate. Most colleges help&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/find-colleges/campus-life/college-roommates-the-basics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    roommates
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &amp;nbsp;get in touch with each other so that they can get to know each other and coordinate on what to bring.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  6. Hit the shops. Think about what&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/get-in/making-a-decision/off-to-college-checklist&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    school supplies and personal items
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &amp;nbsp;you need, want and can afford to buy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  7. Get a physical. Most incoming college students have to submit results from a recent physical exam and vaccination history before registering for classes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  8. See if you have to take any placement exams. Some standardized test scores may help you get out of placement tests, so check the testing requirements on your college’s website.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  9. Ease the transition. Some colleges offer “summer bridge” or “
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bottomline.org/content/college-support&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    college success
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ” classes that provide tutoring, cultural events and academic and financial aid counseling to&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/find-colleges/campus-life/campus-services-theres-support-when-you-need-it&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    help
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &amp;nbsp;you ease into campus life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  10. Say thanks. Your family, teachers, counselors and others probably helped you along your way to college. Let them know how much you appreciate their efforts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  One more for good measure: stay strong! Shifting from high school to college is a big move, but you have been working toward this destination and are academically ready. Being the first to go to college may be hard on your family, but know that they want the best for you. And, know that you are not alone: there are other students on campus who are walking this same path. Take full advantage of all the resources and tools available to help you on&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://roadtripnation.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    your journey
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &amp;nbsp;to college success.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;

Kristen is Executive Director of University Admissions at Adelphi University and president of the New York State Association for College Admission Counseling. This is her first time attending Forum. If you&#039;re interested in blogging for All Access, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/all-access/submit-article&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; or email allaccess@collegeboard.org. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 47 percent of college students in the United States are currently enrolled in community colleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect: &lt;em&gt;What are you doing to serve these students?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As leaders in admission, we carry the immense responsibility of ensuring that today’s transfer students face clear pathways and supportive cradles of guidance, advice, and support. And while our developments have been great, we still have a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a cozy room of professionals focused on the transfer student experience and transfer success, proactive discussions buzzed —sharing exciting developments of community college partnerships, outreach programs, peer mentorships, leadership engagements, and transfer action teams.  And yet, in the same breath, there were shared concerns of a lack of resources, inconsistent campus cultures, misinformed college personnel, skewed political pressures, and troubling completion rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are the agents of change. Each of us carries the ability to address these concerns and ultimately enhance the transfer process. What can we do to propel our transfer culture forward and best serve our students? Know our transfer populations – who they are and where they are coming from. Know how they perform and where they need support. Know the trends in success by region and school. Identify the characteristics of successful transfer students and publicly share those commonalities for better preparation of students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an age where transferring requires a visionary plan, a supportive structure, and a transparent experience, we are challenged as professionals to be holistic and grand-thinking. We are challenged to build support among our communities and constituents. We are challenged to better facilitate the transfer transition in the hopes that one day, our transfer students will no longer be defined by their educational path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Helping Community College Students Transfer and Attain a Bachelor’s Degree&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

School counselors were particularly well represented in this group that had one thing on their minds: how to help more students get into and afford college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pressure of the college admission process and the strain it can put on students’ mental health was a hot topic. “Everyone is stressed,” said Carolyn Blair, director of counseling services at Clayton High School in Missouri, but the stress “ultimately rests on the shoulders of students as they’re trying to navigate [the college admission] process.” She went on to say that a lot of students are self-medicating because of all the stress they feel to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher Watson, dean of undergraduate admission at Northwestern, said that one of his school’s goals was to support these students once they’re on campus. “They’re coming to Northwestern as stressed out as when they left [high school]. We’re adding more mental health professionals to our health offices” to help address the different needs of their students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking to the affordability of college, The Ohio State University’s Vernon Granger addressed how colleges should work to reduce the costs for students. He talked about the need for schools to be more efficient and think critically about how to lessen students’ financial burden. “How many rock climbing walls are too many?” he asked. “Two? Three? These costs are indirectly – and sometimes directly – transferred to our students.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other topics touched upon were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/financial-aid/prior-prior-year-what-it-and-why-it-s-important-start-planning&quot;&gt;FAFSA’s shift to “prior-prior year”&lt;/a&gt; and the importance of student diversity on campus. “Our focus once was on [recruiting] African American students,” said Granger. “Now we’re seeing many other ethnicities be the focus. It has changed the composition of our students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Challenges and Opportunities in Admission and Financial Aid&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

A remarkably even cross-section of counselors, financial aid professionals, and admission officers gathered to hear colleagues discuss the implementation strategy for prior-prior year and its potential challenges over the next several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Ball, associate vice president for enrollment management at Bradley University; Diane Corbett, executive director of student financial aid at The Ohio State University; and Brad Lindberg, director of student financial aid at Grinnell College, joined Anne Sturtevant, the College Board’s executive director of higher education initiatives, to address the many questions that colleges, counselors, and students are asking about prior-prior year. Among them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How will this change affect professional judgment and how aid officers approach students with special circumstances?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How will students’ enrollment behavior change as a result of having more financial aid information earlier?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can institutions leverage these opportunities for change to most benefit students and families?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the practical implications for campus visits, early decision deadlines, and tuition setting?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When should counselors start communicating the changes to students?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there may not be clear answers to all these questions yet, the session provided a space for important discussion about these major considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two parts to prior-prior year: the early availability of the FAFSA (available in October as opposed to January) and families’ ability to report income information from the two previous years. In practice, this means that students will receive earlier information about their financial aid packages and be able to make decisions about where they go to college with that information in-hand. The College Board also recently announced that the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE will accept prior-prior year income information as the base year for applying for institutional aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we think about this from the perspective of students and families, all of a sudden the timeline makes a lot more sense,” said Corbett. “These students and families will now be able to gather all their information and file the FAFSA in October. This is a tremendous opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutions will need to take a hard look at their admission and business practices and policies, and consider making significant shifts in their admission and operational timelines. While this may bring about challenges for institutions, it also brings significant opportunity to disrupt the “business as usual” mentality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session ended with questions from the audience, and Sturtevant reiterated that the College Board will continue to communicate consistently with stakeholders and offer opportunities for counselors, admission officers, students, and financial aid professionals as they navigate the unchartered waters of prior-prior year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Prior-Prior Year’s Impact on Student Financial Aid and Admission&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Read the official statement from the university below or on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://source.wustl.edu/2016/03/ronne-patrick-turner-named-vice-provost-for-admissions/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ronné Patrick Turner, associate vice president of enrollment and dean of admission at Northeastern University, has been appointed vice provost for admissions at Washington University in St. Louis, effective July 1, according to Chancellor Mark S. Wrighton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turner succeeds John Berg, who announced in October that he would retire from the position June 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We could not be more pleased that our national search for our next leader in undergraduate admissions has led us to Ronné Turner,” Wrighton said. “She is an accomplished professional with a proven record of success in not only recruiting top students, but also ensuring that they are prepared to meet and exceed their goals throughout their college careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I also am extremely grateful to John Berg, who in his nearly 30 years of service — 22 of which were spent leading our admissions efforts — has overseen a significant increase in both the number and quality of applicants to Washington University. He leaves a remarkable legacy and a strong foundation for our next chapter under Ronné’s leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her new role, Turner will be responsible for planning and directing the recruitment of undergraduate students to Washington University and for implementing strategies to increase the strength and diversity of the student body. She also will oversee Student Financial Services, which is dedicated to making it financially possible for admitted students to enroll and for enrolled students to graduate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turner comes to Washington University after nearly 15 years at Northeastern, where she leads and directs undergraduate admission and enrollment for the university’s seven colleges and oversees the development and implementation of recruitment and enrollment strategies to meet objectives for freshman, transfer and international students. She also serves on the university’s Enrollment Strategy Committee, which is focused on scholarship and financial aid; and oversees the Opportunity Scholarship unit, which admits and supports approximately 75 first-generation students receiving a range of scholarship aid each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ronné brings the right mix of talent, skill and administrative experience to this critical role,” Provost Holden Thorp said. “As each incoming class becomes more accomplished and excellent in every respect, we are tremendously fortunate to have found the perfect leader to help us maximize the opportunity that is in front of us — to raise the bar, reimagine the possibilities and cultivate the next generation of Washington University students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am thrilled to join the Washington University team and to contribute to the university’s continued enrollment success,” Turner said. “I look forward to working with the entire university community to attract and enroll outstanding students from diverse backgrounds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to joining the Northeastern administration in 2001, Turner had worked for more than a decade at the University of Maryland, College Park, where she served in roles including admission counselor, assistant director for freshman admission, and associate director for admission marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turner also worked as an assistant director of admissions at her alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, where she earned her bachelor’s degree in social and behavioral science. She also earned a master’s degree in social foundations of education from the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among her professional associations, Turner serves on the Board of Trustees of the College Board and as chair of the National Guidance and Admission Assembly, and she has held positions with the College Board New England Regional Association and the National Association for College Admission Counseling. She was honored in 2011 with the Northeastern University Innovation Award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Turner Named Vice Provost for Admissions at Washington University in St. Louis&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This year, ACCUPLACER celebrates its 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary. Throughout its three decades, ACCUPLACER has provided institutions with immediate and accurate results on their students’ strengths and weaknesses in core subjects, while delivering reliable data to aid in college course placement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those early days, Doyle recalled that the need for a program like ACCUPLACER stemmed from colleges’ desire to be able to better assess current students for placement purposes. At the time, the College Board had a program called Comparative Guidance and Placement (GCP), which functioned similarly to an SAT administration. Students took a paper and pencil test, and then waited for the results to come back weeks later. Needing more immediate information about student performance, many colleges were left to create their own tests. Nothing was standardized and institutions couldn’t accurately account for validity and reliability. At the same time, institutions were concerned about attrition attributed to academic misplacement, which often resulted in students dropping courses well after the semester had begun. ACCUPLACER became the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What began as a pilot with 19 participating institutions and four tests has grown into a dynamic program with over 1,500 participating institutions nationwide and dozens of tests for both diagnostic and placement purposes. The ACCUPLACER program continues to innovate with &lt;a href=&quot;https://accuplacer.collegeboard.org/educator/next-generation&quot;&gt;redesigned placement tests&lt;/a&gt; launching this fall. As part of the ACCUPLACER team, I am looking forward to seeing what the future holds for ACCUPLACER and its impact for colleges and students. The complexities of operating a computer-based assessment are many, and we look forward to working with institutions to ensure ACCUPLACER continues to meet their needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Happy 30th Anniversary, ACCUPLACER&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The esteemed panel, with a combined 125 years of experience, featured:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Barbara Polk, deputy director of undergraduate admissions, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ingrid Hayes, vice president for enrollment management, Spelman College&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kerr C. Ramsay III, associate vice president for admissions, High Point University&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tim Amyx, director of admissions &amp;amp; registrar, Volunteer State Community College&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are some highlights from their conversation. Remarks have been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What do admissions officers look for during the review process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barbara Polk&lt;/strong&gt;: We want to get to know the students as individuals, as best we can. The tricky or challenging part is when you have to then take their stories, in some cases from various institutions, and put them into a competitive decision process. And that’s hard to do, because if it’s a holistic review, then you don’t just point to a GPA or a test score and say, ‘If you had 10 points higher here, or if you have GPA had been this instead of that…’ It’s the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Should students be worried about referencing personal stories in their essay?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingrid Hayes&lt;/strong&gt;: As long as the information they’re sharing helps us to understand their journey and their passion for what they do, that is absolutely something that they can share. That’s really what’s important—for students to give that extra coloring, to tell us why this thing was important, why that other thing was important, and to share it with the admission committee. We want to understand their stories. We all want to cheer for our students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Is experiential education a good way to get around the idea of mere “credit-counting”? Is it too difficult for students to take on, or for higher ed institutions to implement? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kerr C. Ramsay III&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s our responsibility to go beyond what we think students can do. I think experiential learning helps students get beyond “credit-counting” or just “information.” And I think we all know as educators that when you really understand something, you’re able to then teach it. That’s the best sign that you understand a concept, when you’re able to share it with someone else in a way that they can understand it. Imagine asking an athlete to only practice all the time and never play a game. We would never do that. But we ask our students to do that all the time in academics, and we think that it’s a bit of a faulty mindset. We need to give our students chance to try and apply their learning each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What other higher education options are out there for students?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim Amyx&lt;/strong&gt;: Let me encourage you to learn about the activity at your community colleges nearby. If you really care about your students, then sometimes you have to have the conversation when you say, “You know what? What you’re facing is overwhelming, and you might be better off taking a baby step, but that baby step doesn’t mean that it’s a bad step.” My biggest retention problem is that the students get to the community college and they find out that it’s hard, that we actually have academic rigor. So, if you’re at a four-year school or you’re K-12 counselors, I encourage you to take the time to find out about all of your students’ higher education options. You may find that there’s a hidden gem in your backyard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Southern Regional Forum Closes with Panel of College Admission Officers&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Between now and May 15, students can share their college decision with a video, Boomerang, or photo—along with the hashtag &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/collegiance/&quot; style=&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); outline: 0px;&quot;&gt;#Collegiance&lt;/a&gt;—to be entered into a contest for a chance to win cash prizes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;We created our #Collegiance campaign to celebrate all those students who have achieved this important milestone,”  Andrew Elwell, director of student communications at the College Board, told USA TODAY College. “We hope this campaign will give students the opportunity to creatively share their decision as they look ahead to their first year of college.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
