Because many of my Advanced Placement Program&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; students are African American and Hispanic/Latino and because I have achieved success both in enrollment and achievement, I am honored to share some of the techniques and programs that have been effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our district, any child who is identified by the College Board as having &lt;a href=&quot;https://appotential.collegeboard.org/app/welcome.do&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“AP potential”&lt;/a&gt; is automatically placed in AP classes. Although this is an easy way of increasing enrollment and certainly has increased the number of minority students in our AP classes, unfortunately some of the students feel they are being forced to take classes. I believe there are more effective ways of encouraging the desire for excellence that involve not only rigor but also fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective tools for encouraging a climate of academia within our district was implementing AP Vertical Teams&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;. I served as Team Leader for the AP Vertical Team for English. When we operated with a team approach, we saw immediate and significant growth in our program. English teachers in grades 6–12 met monthly, and we set up and conducted our own workshops during the summer. We also participated as a group at several College Board–sponsored &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/prof-dev/workshops&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;workshops&lt;/a&gt;. Working together gave us a common language, a common purpose, and a shared vision of how to navigate our curriculum to truly reflect the movement from Pre-AP&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; to AP. We became invested in the students who we collectively identified as early as sixth grade and then followed their progress right through graduation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To encourage community involvement in our AP program, our Vertical Team held AP Saturday sessions. These fun and educational workshops were open to students (and their parents) identified as having AP potential. These Saturday sessions were always well attended and included the ever-popular pizza party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the most successful ways of encouraging minority students to participate in our program was the launch of “TEAM AP.” We held a T-shirt design contest that challenged students to develop a T-shirt that would rival the team-spirit shirts our school athletes wear before their games. The winning design was developed incorporated into the Team AP shirt that TEAM AP members wore every Friday. We handed out T-shirts to all potential AP students and their teachers from grades 6 to 12, which enhanced our homegrown version of academic team building. Even kids who had no interest in AP were very interested in how they could “get one of those shirts.” I currently teach students who still have the shirt that they received in sixth grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I made it a point to attend every professional development opportunity offered by College Board. The Summer Institutes and my attendance at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apac.collegeboard.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AP Annual Conference&lt;/a&gt; significantly changed and shaped the way I approach recruitment and the way I teach the course itself. Probably the professional highlight of my entire teaching career was being selected to &lt;a href=&quot;https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/professional-development/become-an-ap-reader&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;score&lt;/a&gt; the AP English Language and Composition Exam. It is impossible to put into words how significant and invaluable that experience was for me as an educator. Suffice it to say it is something I would encourage all AP teachers to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;

This is one of the best professional development opportunities that my school district pays for. APAC is not just about the content I teach in my World History class, but about the things I hear from my fellow teachers in other subjects. I am able to see connections across disciplines instead of staying isolated within my own classroom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is one thing you have learned so far?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have learned AP world history is kicking ass. The number of students taking the course is growing, and exam scores are growing as well. It’s a hard course to teach—there is so much content. Seeing that my students are doing better makes the hard work pay off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will you bring back to your school?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will share with my colleagues that we have more in common than we tend to think. We’re all teaching the high level students, but perhaps there needs to be more collaboration—what you’re doing in your chemistry class I can use in my world history class. Collaboration is important. The students know it and express that all the time; that what they learned in their English class applies to what I’m teaching them in World History. It’s helpful when we can make connections across disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anything else you want to add?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll probably go back and refine my lesson plans. I want to make sure it’s not just about a test—learning in AP goes beyond the classroom and the test. That’s my focus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Overheard at APAC: AP® World History Teacher Cherie Pinchem&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I am really not that out of touch with the wonders of technology, I just get busy working with the kids and forget about all the new things that could really make my life — and especially my teaching life — better. So, here goes … my first blog — whatever that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I live in Salt Lake City and teach at East High School, which has, over the years, changed demographically from an upper-middle class, fairly universally white school to an inner-city school with a population of 2,000 students, 62 percent of whom are students of color (mostly Hispanic) and about 55 percent of whom qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. I have been teaching for 39 years in three public schools and one private school in Salt Lake City. Originally, I went to East High to teach in the at-risk program, but the principal knew (as does everybody in Salt Lake City) that for the majority of my career, dating back to 1985 or ‘86, I taught AP United States History. So when the AP teacher retired earlier than expected — in midyear, no less — guess who, in January of 2013, became the AP U.S. History teacher?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I inherited two sections of AP U.S. History, with about 40 kids in each class (don’t gasp, this is Utah, where we “stack ‘em deep, and teach ‘em cheap”). There were about eight students of color in both AP classes combined. As a school, we had been talking about how to get our minority students to participate in AP, but frankly, it was mostly lip service. So, as a person of color,  I decided that the enrollment in AP U.S. History for the 2013-14 school year had to be exactly like that of our school — 62 percent students of color.  I only kind of knew what I had gotten myself into; the enrollment was actually the easy part. First, I asked for a list of all the students in 10th-grade World History, about 425 students. Next, I sent letters to the students and their parents explaining what AP is and why the students should take my course. Then, I identified the minority students and met with them individually, explaining why they needed to take AP U.S. History. If students were reluctant to sign up for the course, I made phone calls and home visits to the parents, registration cards in hand. What I learned was that many of the students had heard of AP, but believed that it was “too hard” for them. Many told me flat out that AP was “only for white kids.” In reality, most were afraid of failing and had incorporated what they had heard from other students into their self-image.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, the new school year started, with 185 students enrolled in AP U.S. History, 30 percent of them students of color; not the goal, but a significant improvement. Then, the real work started. I found that students didn’t read well or enough, so I used a number of strategies from the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vertical Teams Guide for Social Studies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In addition, I used the strategies from the old “Building Success” workshop, renamed “Strategies for Social Studies and Language Arts Teachers.” Specifically, I used the Levels of Questions strategy as a place to start. Next, we used the SOAPS strategy. One of the first assignments was to read “The Strange Death of Silas Deane” from a collection called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;After the Fact.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; This article helps students to understand that history isn’t just the past, it’s how historians view and write &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; the past, and how they make selections about what should be included in history books. Next, we read a primary source (the police report) about the shooting of Trayvon Martin. I asked students if they thought that justice was served in the George Zimmerman trial. Once students got into the primary sources — studying conflicting sources, offering their inferences and opinions, and collaboratively discussing the evidence — they were hooked.  From that point in the school year, the intellectual spark was lit, and we worked like we were on fire. I never focused much attention on taking the AP Exam — I didn’t want to create negative energy or stress. More than anything, the minority students in particular needed to believe in themselves — that they could actually do the work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A friend of mine who is a professional photographer took pictures of every student, and under the headings “I Am Smart,” “I Am Talented,” and “I Can Achieve,” we placed 8 x 10 glossy color prints of each student. We called it the Wall of Fame.  Were they prepared for AP? No. Was much of the work they did of AP quality? Eventually. My goal was to set the bar higher but not too high; like teaching kids to ride a bicycle, I raised the training wheels a bit every month. Every paper they wrote could be rewritten for a higher grade.  We worked on critical reading skills, outlining, Cornell notes, and conceptual identifications. I held after-school seminars for one hour every Wednesday and Thursday, offering extra credit (a concept I hate) if kids would come. By October, I was working 80 hours per week, so I enlisted the help of my university students (I teach history part time at the University of Utah) to help score papers and tutor kids during class and after school. I awarded good grades for effort more than content, encouraging students to rewrite. I used lots of primary documents, real historical dilemmas, funny YouTube videos, and lots of positive encouragement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the course of the school year, only one student had dropped the class. In May, 80 of my students took the AP Exam. I don’t know how they did — but that isn’t exactly the point. The goal was to build self-esteem and confidence; to help the students realize that college-level work is more about commitment and effort than about being smart or, for that matter, white. For some, just completing the course was a victory; for others, taking the test was a victory. Some may actually earn scores of 3 or above.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next year, there will be 205 students — about 35 percent of whom are students of color —enrolled in AP U.S. History at my school going through essentially the same process as this past year but with the help of Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) teachers, who are trained in helping underachieving students with high academic potential to succeed. What I’ve learned from this experience is that first, students must develop confidence in their abilities; second, they need constant positive encouragement. Teachers need to be ready and willing to work with students of all academic levels, and to be ready to implement individual strategies and assignments as needed.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I reflect on this school year, I am so exhausted that I can hardly believe that in about eight short weeks, I will be at it again, with a completely new energy and with a new AP U.S. History course to implement. At least, I hope I will have new energy — &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; energy would be welcomed at this point, but thankfully that’s why we have the summer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Teacher Talk: Reflections on AP® Participation from Salt Lake City, UT &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
