&lt;p&gt;I’m delighted to be at Forum this year because this is my region, the WRO, and the opportunity to network and meet with some of the members that are the schools that help serve.  For example, I’m thrilled that Steve Fisk from North Central High School in Spokane, which is one of our school that does the school day SAT, Springboard and Capstone, is here presenting and talking about how they have shifted the mindset in this highly impoverished school to one where all students get the opportunity to experience the joy that is AP and some of the other opportunities to propel them to college success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What session are you most interesting in attending?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They all are so good!  I’m excited that Kelly Stromberg, a teacher at North central, is talking about Capstone because it’s such an exciting program, which provides kids a rigorous opportunity to learn about the things that are important not just for college but for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is one thing that you’ve learned so far?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was delighted to listen to both David Coleman and Sal Kahn talk about the work we are doing in terms of our partnership.  Davdid Coleman is an incredible speaker, and I learned about where the word “freedom” came from!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will you take what you&#039;ve learned at Forum and use it in your day to day work at the College Board?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m excited about attending sessions that talk about propelling students, especially underrepresented students, especially African-American students, into Advance Placement, so I’m really excited to learn about some of the things that other school districts have been using in order to connect kids to AP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Overheard at Forum: Nancy Potter, Director of State and District Partnerships and K12, Western Regional Office of the College Board&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the full letter: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November 19, 2014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Colleague:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a country, we are leaving far too much talent on the table. Too many high achieving African American, Latino, and Native American students — students who have demonstrated the potential to do well in Advanced Placement® (AP®) courses — are not enrolling in those courses. This is an enormous missed opportunity for them and for all of us working for a stronger, fairer, and more secure nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ground that’s been gained for these students has largely been the result of the inspired and dogged work of superintendents, school board members, staff, and teachers in our major cities. The new partnership between the Council of the Great City Schools, the College Board, and the White House — through its My Brother’s Keeper initiative — aims to bolster the good work already under way, share lessons learned as broadly as possible, and dramatically increase the proportion of students of color with AP potential who are enrolled in AP courses. We are pleased to announce that the National Council of La Raza, the National Urban League, and The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights will also be joining us in this effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real success of this effort depends on you, your schools, counselors, and teachers. Success — we have learned from leading districts — is a dynamic mixture of good data and human interaction. Without the data, we can’t effectively target outreach and resources. The College Board’s AP Potential™ tool provides critical information about which students have demonstrated — by their performance on the PSAT/NMSQT® — potential to succeed in AP. PSAT/NMSQT scores often uncover academic ability that might otherwise be overlooked, and they spotlight those students ready to be successful in AP. And in focus group after focus group, these students tell us that the single most important factor in their decision to take an AP class was the support and encouragement from adults in their school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are in the strongest position to make a difference — by establishing a clear districtwide priority, by setting public goals for improvement, by monitoring progress at individual schools, and by providing guidance and support to your principals as they encourage students with AP potential to take these courses. We at the College Board and the Council of the Great City Schools have found our collaboration to be invaluable, and we believe that you will too. We have asked the College Board’s regional vice presidents to set up meetings in December with each of you. The purpose of these meetings is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review the PSAT/NMSQT data for your districts and schools;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set goals for improving AP enrollment of African American, Native American, and Latino students this spring;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify needs that your district will have in meeting these goals; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assess how the College Board and the Council can help you meet these goals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For reference, we are including a possible agenda for these meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next couple of weeks, a member of the College Board staff will be in touch with you about setting up an initial meeting. In the interim, we invite you to view this webinar about the steps you can take to propel our students forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you will consider sharing it with the principals and counselors in your district as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or need any additional information, please feel free to reach out to Amy Wilkins (&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:awilkins@collegeboard.org&quot;&gt;awilkins@collegeboard.org&lt;/a&gt;) or Ray Hart (&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:rhart@cgcs.org&quot;&gt;rhart@cgcs.org&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Casserly&lt;/strong&gt;, Executive Director of the Council of the Great City Schools and &lt;strong&gt;David Coleman&lt;/strong&gt;, President and CEO of the College Board&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Letter to CGCS Superintendents from David Coleman and Michael Casserly&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>Renewing Our Commitment to Being All In: A Letter From the President</title>

&lt;p&gt;The events and conversations of the last few weeks remind us all that we have a long way to go to become the fairer, stronger, more equitable nation that we should be. While the College Board can’t effectively address all the racial issues our country faces, we are fully committed to doing everything we can to ensure that &lt;em&gt;every &lt;/em&gt;student has access to all the academic opportunity he or she has earned and that we can provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is with a renewed sense of purpose and conviction that I write to tell you about year two of the “All In” campaign, the College Board’s effort to ensure that &lt;em&gt;every &lt;/em&gt;African American, Latino, and Native American student who shows potential to succeed in an AP subject takes at least one corresponding, or matched, AP course. Currently, only about half of these students are enrolled in the AP courses for which they have shown potential even though the majority of these students attend schools that offer the classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the campaign will not begin in earnest until January, when schools reopen after the holiday break, there is already a great deal of exciting and important work under way. Here are some of the most recent examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The state of &lt;strong&gt;Delaware&lt;/strong&gt; has committed to the campaign as a part of its “Getting to Zero” initiative.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;University of California&lt;/strong&gt; system has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-college-board-expand-partnership-reach-underrepresented-students&quot;&gt;joined the campaign&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Pittsburgh school district&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2014/11/28/Pittsburgh-programs-pushes-blacks-to-take-advanced-high-school-courses/stories/201411260138&quot;&gt;already on the move&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pittsburgh is just one of 61 school districts that, through the &lt;strong&gt;Council of the Great City Schools&lt;/strong&gt; (CGCS), has committed to ensuring that all young men of color with AP potential enroll in matched AP classes. I was honored to deliver the keynote at the CGCS national conference this year. Following the conference, Mike Casserly, executive director of CGCS, and I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/academic/letter-cgcs-superintendents-david-coleman-and-michael-casserly&quot;&gt;sent a joint letter&lt;/a&gt; to the superintendents and created a primer on boosting the enrollment of students of color in AP classes that highlights strong AP equity work in &lt;strong&gt;Hillsborough County, Fla.; Houston ISD, Texas; Long Beach Unified School District, Calif.; Montgomery County, Md.; and New Haven, Conn. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our own members are also fully engaged in year two of All In. In November, &lt;strong&gt;College Board New England Regional Council member Nancy Barile &lt;/strong&gt;moderated &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegeboardtraining.webex.com/collegeboardtraining/lsr.php?RCID=e3d031570cf141718ef0bc6a08ccd293&quot;&gt;a terrific webinar&lt;/a&gt; on successful strategies to boost the enrollment of students of color in AP classes. Webinar speakers included &lt;strong&gt;George Henry&lt;/strong&gt;, an AP U.S. History teacher since 1985 and an AP Reader since 1991 who currently serves on the &lt;strong&gt;Academic Advisory Committee&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Beth Arey&lt;/strong&gt;, who currently serves the College Board as chair-elect for the &lt;strong&gt;Midwestern Regional&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Council&lt;/strong&gt;; and&lt;strong&gt; Joanne Lang&lt;/strong&gt;, executive vice president of Kentucky Science and Technology Corporation and executive director of AdvanceKentucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s all &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the campaign gets under way! There’s lots more to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming majority of the good work that has already happened and will continue springs not from those of us who work at the College Board, but from the resolve and activism of educators and administrators in every part of this country. The College Board’s goal for All In is to support and amplify the work of those women and men who, day in and day out, work at their schools and in their districts to deliver more fairness and opportunity to students of color.  It’s my honor to support their efforts and the students whom they serve. If you’ve not already taken action to eliminate the AP participation gap in your community or at your school, I urge you to join me in supporting the educators in your community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

The fellowship is designed to recognize, support, and reward rising leaders from African American, Latino, and Native American backgrounds who are working effectively to close achievement and attainment gaps in their schools, colleges, and communities across the country. By highlighting and supporting these leaders, the College Board is seeking to reinforce its commitment to the essential work of propelling all students forward into opportunities and success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a collaborative process that included over 50 staff readers from across the organization as well as the full senior leadership team, 21 fellows were selected to receive one-time awards of $5,000 to sustain their ongoing, high-impact efforts. Fifteen fellows from the inaugural cohort were able to attend the 2014 College Board National Forum in Las Vegas. Along with attending sessions and meetings with many of the volunteer staff who read their applications, fellows also had an opportunity on October 28&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; to meet with David Coleman, members of the senior leadership, and quite a few of our Trustees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meet and greet on October 28&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; at the ARIA hotel was amazing. Fellows were able to share their work with the senior leadership of our organization and really talk about how their grant awards were pushing forward opportunities for students of color both in K–12 and higher education. Fellows are working on a range of issues and tackling many of the pervasive problems in our education system in fresh and creative ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are excited about the success of this limited, first-year pilot and hope to widen the scope of the program next year. Below is a complete list of our inaugural fellows, who will be profiled in a series of All Access posts during the next few weeks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Albert Brass Jr.&lt;/strong&gt; Advanced Placement Program Coordinator at Joliet West High School (Joliet, IL)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deshonna Collier-Goubil&lt;/strong&gt; Assistant Professor, Department of Sociology, Biola University (La Mirada, CA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Savanna Flakes&lt;/strong&gt; Inclusion Specialist, Alexandria City Public Schools (Alexandria, VA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reagan Flowers&lt;/strong&gt; President and CEO of CSTEM (Houston, TX)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James DeLano Ford&lt;/strong&gt; Deputy Superintendent, Louisiana Recovery School District (New Orleans, LA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nneka Fritz&lt;/strong&gt; President and Lead Consultant, Higher Ground Education Consulting (Brooklyn, NY)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elizabeth Garcia&lt;/strong&gt; Dean of Multicultural Affairs, Connecticut College (New London, CT)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tomeka Hart&lt;/strong&gt; Vice President, Programs of the Southern Education Foundation (Atlanta, GA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elijah Heckstall&lt;/strong&gt; Dean of Students, Excel Academy Charter School (Chelsea, MA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoelene Hill&lt;/strong&gt;  Ph.D. student at Duke University, Sanford School of Public Policy (Durham, NC)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efrain Mercado&lt;/strong&gt; Policy Director at California County Superintendents Educational Services Association (Sacremento, CA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isabel Morales&lt;/strong&gt; Doctoral Candidate, University of Southern California; Founding Teacher, Los Angeles High School of the Arts (Los Angeles, CA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Perry&lt;/strong&gt; School Design Fellow, Expanded Success Initiative (ESI), NYC Department of Education (Brooklyn, NY)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harry Preston&lt;/strong&gt; STEM Teacher, Edmondson Westside High School, (Baltimore, MD)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kalimah Priforce&lt;/strong&gt; Cofounder, Qeyno Labs (Oakland, CA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daphne L.

At Wednesday’s opening plenary luncheon, three powerful and influential D.C. leaders — who just happen to be women — sat down with College Board President David Coleman to talk about the strides their city has made, and continues to make, in educating its children and keeping them safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayor Muriel Bowser, Schools Chancellor Kaya Henderson, and Chief of Police Cathy Lanier spoke with fierce pride about Washington’s gains in NAEP reading and math scores and having the country’s highest rate of students signing up for the FAFSA – which means more students will be more likely to go to college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are raising our expectations about what [students] can achieve,” said Mayor Bowser, “and we know that when they leave our schools, they are prepared.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support, positivity, and engagement were all cited as important factors in positioning students to be successful in life. “We’ve made it a real priority to engage students and families,” said Chancellor Henderson. “We speak positivity and opportunity into young people’s lives … and [that] will absolutely determine their trajectory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Lanier agreed, adding that it is important to focus on the actual individuals whose lives you are improving – rather than numbers or statistics. “Policing isn’t about making arrests, it’s about making connections,” she said. “Investing in nontraditional policing and community engagement has reduced kids involved in homicides 63 percent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the discussion, David Coleman asked if there were any areas the panelists wanted to see faster progress in — or where they wanted things to slow down. Chief Lanier cited the speed at which technology changes as one of her biggest barriers, while Mayor Bowser was eager to get things moving more than ever. “I feel like I have to go fast every single day,” she said. “We have a legislative agenda that’s aggressive, and we should go fast – but we have to be strategic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;3 DC Women Steal the Show at Forum 2015 Opening Plenary&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>The Partners that Make the College Board Stronger</title>

&lt;p&gt;One of those partners that make us stronger is bringing the U.S. Constitution to life with technology. Jeffrey Rosen, president and CEO of the National Constitution Center, has led the development of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution&quot;&gt;Interactive Constitution&lt;/a&gt;. With this innovative tool, students can explore the historic roots of each amendment, compare U.S. and international protections, and read opposing views to the interpretation of each amendment. “I believe this exercise of civil discourse does have the potential to transform constitutional education in America,” said Rosen.  AP U.S. History teachers are already using this tool, and Rosen hopes all students will use the Interactive Constitution to learn about history and become more informed citizens.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman also introduced Fidel Vargas, president and CEO of the Hispanic Scholarship Fund (HSF), as the “leader of a revolutionary effort engaging students in their work.”  HSF uses data from the PSAT/NMSQT to identify Hispanic students for scholarship opportunities. Vargas pointed out that one thing that often gets overlooked is that 93 percent of Latinos under the age of 18 living in the United States are U.S. citizens, and that’s important to keep in mind when considering the country’s future. To date, HSF has awarded more than half a billion dollars to over 6,500 Latino students and alumni.  “As a nation, whether we are training leaders to go into politics or into science or into law, there is a training and a mentorship that in some ways has been lost,” said Vargas, “so it’s not just the scholarships we give these students, it’s the support — the mentorship we are providing — that is making the real difference in accelerating their career paths.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another man focused on propelling careers forward is Hadi Partovi, co-founder and CEO of Code.org, another College Board partner. “Hadi has an ambitious and timely agenda that is sweeping this country,” said Coleman. After Partovi introduced a program titled “One Hour of Code,” in which any school in America can receive a free, 60-minute video tutorial on how to code, students have clocked more than 100 million hours of code in the past two years. “Every single child should learn about algorithmic thinking or how the Internet works — it’s just a basic thing that every child in the 21st century should have as part of their well-rounded education,” said Partovi. More than 5 million students took the tutorial, 2 million of whom were girls. Since launching our partnership with Code.org, over 90 school districts nationwide have added computer science courses, and the enrollment in AP Computer Science A has almost doubled, making it the fastest-growing course for the College Board.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Coleman, partnerships are about not only enhancing the College Board’s services to students and families but also offering support to institutions that can benefit from the collaboration.  “Assessment without opportunity is dead,” said Coleman in his closing remarks, “but with these kinds of partners, the College Board can share very powerful things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;The Partners that Make the College Board Stronger&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

That’s one of the first things he told the audience at his town hall discussion Wednesday afternoon at Forum 2015. He prefers to be honest, candid, forthright. And so, when he was asked about the subtle differences in administering the PSAT/NMSQT and the PSAT 8/9, he answered honestly: “I don’t have a command over the last-minute proctoring guidelines,” and he did not want to “dishonor” the importance of these technical questions by providing incomplete or incorrect information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, he gave out a College Board email address to which technical questions could be sent and ensured attendees that someone who did know the answers would get back to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exchange set the tone for the 75-minute discussion, in which Coleman reiterated the need for assessments to provide real opportunities for students and elaborated on the difference between “test prep” and “test practice”: “‘Catching up’ doesn’t happen in the few moments before the test,” he said, referring to last-minute cramming sessions. “The only things that really make a difference are great courses and productive practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One question from the audience about how the idea of “common standards” is misperceived by many spurred a particularly thoughtful response from Coleman: “I’m very discouraged about all of the fog around this. If you say ‘kids should have command of the founding documents and the great conversation they inspire’ — 98 percent of the population agrees.” The same, he said, held true when asking if people thought it was important for students to be able to read passages and answer questions based on evidence found in the reading. “Instead of saying ‘common standards,’ just say the specific skills,” and most people will agree. “That’s my best answer,” he said. “Get more specific.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;A Candid Discussion with David Coleman&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;As SAT enters a new era this week, students say the exam has improved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/people/nick-anderson&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(46, 109, 157); font-family: FranklinITCProBold, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nick Anderson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-normal modal-0 horizontal-photo&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; border-top-width: 0px; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: FranklinITCProLight, HelveticaNeue, &#039;Helvetica Neue Light&#039;, &#039;Helvetica Neue&#039;, Helvetica, Arial, &#039;Lucida Grande&#039;, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;courtesy-of-the-resizer zoom-in&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_908w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/03/01/Others/Images/2016-02-29/COLLEGEBOARD_Paskova_0041456793468.jpg&amp;amp;w=1484&quot; style=&quot;cursor:-webkit-zoom-in; width:619px&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;College Board President David Coleman at his office in Manhattan.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK — The SAT’s infamous guessing penalty is gone. Its vocabulary is less arcane, minus words like “lachrymose” and “obsequious” that students tended to memorize and then forget. Its essay is now optional. The perfect score — set in 2005 at 2400 — is reverting to the iconic standard from generations past: 1600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most important change to the retooled college admission test that debuts this week for hundreds of thousands of students nationwide lies in its approach to what they learn in high school. The new version of the SAT aims more than ever to measure core skills taught in school, such as reading charts, analyzing evidence and applying algebra in mathematical problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board, which owns the 90-year-old test, sought to purge the tricky questions — akin to brain teasers — that were vestiges of what used to be called a “scholastic aptitude” measurement. The theory behind aptitude testing was to find innate potential in students regardless of where they went to school. Now the SAT is officially described as an achievement test meant to reward those who study hard in class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It most resembles the work that kids are already doing in the classroom,” College Board President David Coleman said this week in in an interview with The Washington Post at his office here in New York. “I think the old SAT was a departure from kids’ everyday work, in their schoolwork. Evidently. It was almost universally felt to be so.”&lt;/p&gt;

(Family photo)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo Barrillon and Jordana Graveley, juniors at Conard High School in West Hartford, Conn., called the revision an improvement. They took the SAT on Wednesday during school along with 40,000 other 11th-graders in Connecticut, with testing fees fully paid by the state. Both also had taken the old version in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I noticed that in the reading, there were a lot more ‘evidence-based’ questions,” said Barrillon, 16. “You would have to find a source from the text to support your answer to the previous question. That was definitely different.” Barrillon said he believed the new test reflected his studies more than the old one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo-right modal-2&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; margin: 0.5em 0px 10px 20px; padding: 0px; float: right; clear: right; max-width: 100%; border: 0px none; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: FranklinITCProLight, HelveticaNeue, &#039;Helvetica Neue Light&#039;, &#039;Helvetica Neue&#039;, Helvetica, Arial, &#039;Lucida Grande&#039;, sans-serif; width: 150px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;66401f335d&quot; id=&quot;66401f335d&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Jordana Graveley (family photo)&quot; class=&quot;zoom-in&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2016/03/graveley-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;cursor:-webkit-zoom-in; max-width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jordana Graveley. (Family photo)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a lot more focused on what we have learned in school,” Gravely, also 16, agreed. One of the reading passages, she said, was a document that covered material familiar from history lessons. “The vocab was really actually something that you would encounter in real life,” she said. The old SAT penalized students for incorrect answers, to deter guessing. But the new SAT eliminates that rule. “It’s a lot less of learning how to take the test than the old one was,” Graveley said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new SAT also was rolled out Wednesday in schools in the District of Columbia, New Hampshire, selected New York City schools, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Jose, and in Florida’s Hillsborough and Seminole counties. On Saturday morning, 277,000 students from across the country are scheduled to sit for the test. In all, 463,000 students are expected to take the new SAT this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruce Reed, a test-preparation consultant in California, said student perceptions about the new SAT matter less, in the end, than whether the test yields reliable and valid results to help admissions officers do their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Isn’t it ultimately about the colleges?” he said. “It’s a hollow victory if it’s just a test that feels better when you’re taking it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revision has been years in the making. Coleman, one of the architects of the Common Core State Standards, was given a mandate to rethink the admission test when he took the helm of the College Board in 2012. The Common Core spells out what students should learn in math and English language arts from kindergarten through high school. Those standards, and the assessments connected to them, were widely adopted but have proven politically controversial. The College Board considered Coleman’s expertise an asset as the nonprofit organization grappled with discontent about its marquee test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-normal horizontal-photo modal-3&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: FranklinITCProLight, HelveticaNeue, &#039;Helvetica Neue Light&#039;, &#039;Helvetica Neue&#039;, Helvetica, Arial, &#039;Lucida Grande&#039;, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;ce49200722&quot; id=&quot;ce49200722&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;courtesy-of-the-resizer zoom-in&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_908w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/03/01/Others/Images/2016-02-29/COLLEGEBOARD_Paskova_0091456793470.jpg&amp;amp;w=1484&quot; style=&quot;cursor:-webkit-zoom-in; width:619px&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;A screen in the lobby of the office of College Board president David Coleman, in Manhattan, on Feb. 29.

&lt;p&gt;The last overhaul of the SAT, in 2005, added a writing section with a required 25-minute essay, worth a maximum of 800 points, to the math and critical reading sections, also worth up to 800 points each. In ensuing years, the SAT lost market share to the rival ACT admission test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACT, based in Iowa, assesses English, reading, math and science, with an optional essay. It has long been perceived as a straightforward achievement test, with slightly higher time pressure per question than the SAT. It does not have a guessing penalty, and it has never purported to measure aptitude. Colleges now accept either test equally, and in 2012, the ACT surpassed the SAT in usage. In the nation’s Class of 2015, about 1.9 million students took the ACT, compared to 1.7 million who took the SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/12/24/the-sat-now-the-no-2-college-test-pushes-to-reclaim-supremacy/&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(46, 109, 157); border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(212, 212, 212); zoom: 1;&quot;&gt;The SAT, now the No. 2 college test, pushes to reclaim supremacy&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One cannot ignore we’re in competition with the ACT,” Coleman acknowledged. But he said that was not the main driver of the SAT changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman unveiled his vision for the new SAT in March 2014. He wanted a transparent test, stripped of trickery and grounded firmly in what students learn. He also announced that the College Board would team with the nonprofit Khan Academy to offer students free online tutorials for the SAT, a measure aiming to reduce the advantage of families wealthy enough to hire private test-preparation consultants. Since June, 900,000 students have registered with Khan for SAT practice and have completed 39 million problems, Coleman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old SAT took 3 hours and 45 minutes. The new version is 3 hours, plus another 50 minutes for those who opt to write an essay. The two core sections are math and “evidence-based reading and writing.” Most of the questions are multiple-choice, but some math questions require students to write in an answer. The math section focuses on algebra, data analysis and fluency with complex equations and expressions in preparation for advanced math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculators, previously allowed throughout the math section, are now barred from certain portions of the new test. There also is less emphasis on geometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/college-board-releases-preview-of-new-sat-exam-questions/2014/04/15/d59f2f9c-c4a1-11e3-bcec-b71ee10e9bc3_story.html&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(46, 109, 157); border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(212, 212, 212); zoom: 1;&quot;&gt;College Board releases preview of new SAT exam questions&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some prominent universities in recent years — including Wake Forest and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/07/27/george-washington-university-applicants-no-longer-need-to-take-admissions-tests/&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(46, 109, 157); border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(212, 212, 212); zoom: 1;&quot;&gt;George Washington — have dropped requirements&lt;/a&gt;for applicants to submit SAT or ACT scores. Critics of the tests say that they are a needless barrier to college access for disadvantaged students, and that transcripts and other information can tell colleges all they need to know about an applicant’s academic potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the large majority of selective colleges, in the Ivy League and beyond, continue to require submission of scores. They will be watching closely how the revised SAT performs its mission of helping to predict college success. That could take years to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re quite optimistic that it will be at least as good as the old test,” said William R. Fitzsimmons, longtime dean of admissions and financial aid at Harvard University. “But we have to wait and see.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitzsimmons predicted that many students will cheer getting rid of flash-card vocabulary — “words that appear only once in your lifetime, but really have no connection to what you encounter in college or after college.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah Quinlan, dean of undergraduate admissions at Yale, said getting ready for college should never be about tricks or last-minute cramming for a test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I believe that the redesigned SAT is on the right path in its transparency and openness, and that it sends the clear signal that if you work hard and achieve, we in higher education will work to open doors for you,” Quinlan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbara Jenkins, superintendent of schools in Orange County, Fla., which serves tens of thousands of students from low-income families, said she is “most excited” about changes to the SAT that suggest its payoffs are not reserved only for the elite or for those who can afford a prep course. The message, she said, is that practice pays off for anybody. “There’s not some anointing that you’re ‘smart’ or ‘not smart,&#039;” Jenkins said. “Instead, it’s something you work toward to open opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education is replete with inequities, from preschool through college, with students from affluent backgrounds enjoying far more educational resources; there are strong correlations between standardized test scores and family income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman said he is mindful that those inequities are stubborn. But he said the SAT’s revision, coupled with the Khan Academy initiative, gives the College Board a strong reply to critics who say that privilege can purchase an edge in opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You say ‘SAT’ and people say, ‘Well what about the test prep?&#039;” Coleman said. He said that many people wonder “how can a challenge be fair if the tools of practice are costly, and if there’s a sense of mystery and that some people can sell you the secrets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step to reform was clear, he said: “I had to get rid of the secrets.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>David Coleman on the Value of Religious Education </title>

Coleman’s remarks focused on two themes: the unique value of religious education, and the College Board’s responsibility to ensure assessments deliver opportunity to all students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Education is a soul craft,” Coleman began. And religious education in particular, he continued, cultivates a set of values that can benefit all students. “I think religious schools have gifts to give and habits to instill that can help the broader public and the larger education system.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are five of those values, according to Coleman. (Remarks have been lightly edited and condensed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productive solitude&lt;/strong&gt;: In our age, the technology of interruption has far outpaced the technology of concentration. And it&#039;s time to admit that being serious about academic and spiritual work requires being alone, and being productive alone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reverent reading of shared texts&lt;/strong&gt;: When facing a difficult and beautiful text, without submitting to it, without patiently allowing it to insist, without reading it with care again and again, I think you cannot read it. To read well is a kind of supplication. The ability to see the crafted thing is so beautiful that you experience text with reverence. As C.S. Lewis said, ‘In the face of the work of art, look and look again. See exactly what is there. Forget yourself. Get out of the way.’ And having a few shared texts in common, that everyone reads, allows us to have a dialogue together. I think that is worthwhile and is something we are increasingly losing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restful excellence&lt;/strong&gt;: Restful excellence is the conscious ability to balance education with life—  to not only cultivate knowledge but to also experience resilience. The other extreme — frenzied excellence, when students fill their schedules doing many things but do not cultivate passion for one or two things — is not the answer to success at the college level and beyond. We should give students space to focus on sustained excellence, which allows them more time for family and faith and to enjoy life as a kid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grace and gratitude&lt;/strong&gt;: I was with admissions officers from elite schools from around the country, and they were lamenting the lack of gratitude in many students today. In the face of this trend, instilling in students a daily sense of gratitude — the grace to pause and be thankful — is a remarkably valuable gift that religious education can give to students.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dignity and pricelessness&lt;/strong&gt;: Many forces in the world tell you we should only do things for the sake of other things, or when it counts for something. But the best of worldly success is a highly crafted, soulful self. Every great business, nonprofit, and institution has behind it a vision or a set of ideas; at their finest, great leaders understand what it means to be animated by something larger than themselves. Religious educators are engaged in the sacred crafting of this kind of character, of this kind of engagement — to serve something deeper. They are investing in the habits that not only make for success, but also for a life that is satisfying.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coleman closed his remarks by discussing the College Board’s focused efforts to foster opportunity for all students. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzDUC5AWkn4&quot;&gt;Watch the full keynote address online.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;David Coleman on the Value of Religious Education &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The College Board is working to prepare Latino students for success in a number of ways, explained Coleman — by &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat&quot;&gt;redesigning the SAT&lt;/a&gt; and removing the obscure “SAT words” that many Latino students struggled with on the old test; by investing in access to &lt;a href=&quot;https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/exploreap&quot;&gt;AP courses&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/counseling-admissions-academic/news-all-campaign-aims-get-more-latino-students&quot;&gt;AP All In&lt;/a&gt; campaign; and by ensuring that all Latino students get free, world-class &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;SAT preparation&lt;/a&gt; through the College Board’s partnership with Khan Academy. “We now have equal number of Latinos participating in Khan Academy as those participating in the SAT,” he announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An area for improvement, he continued, is to ensure Latino students realize their potential. College Board research shows that 57% of Latino students who have potential to succeed in AP coursework do not participate in at least one matched AP exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a scandal that there are so many Latino students across this country who are ready for academic opportunities who then betray themselves by not taking them,” he said. And unfortunately, that trend continues in college — the number of Latinos who enroll in college is much lower than the number who have the potential to succeed in college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman pointed out that religious communities and schools are key to addressing these issues. “If we are going to speak seriously about moving the Latino community, engaging with families, and getting more students to apply broadly to college,” he told the audience, “how can we ignore the remarkable and central force the religious community has in this conversation?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman invited Dr. Carlos Campo, president of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ashland.edu/administration/president&quot;&gt;Ashland University&lt;/a&gt; in Ohio and chair of the Alliance for Hispanic Education for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nhclc.org&quot;&gt;National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference&lt;/a&gt; (NHCLC), to continue this conversation with him during the first Prepárate plenary session, “Conversations about Reverence and Excellence: Faith and Opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the son of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/25/arts/music/pupi-campo-cuban-bandleader-and-the-rumba-maestro-dies-at-91.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;Cuban bandleader&lt;/a&gt; and a singer from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatentertainersarchives.blogspot.com/2011/11/forgotten-ones-betty-clooney.html&quot;&gt;Clooney Sister Singers&lt;/a&gt; (yes, George Clooney is his cousin!), Dr. Campo admitted he was an unlikely candidate to become president of a university. His parents did not graduate from high school, but they made him believe education was the key to his future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My parents had me look up. They made me believe I could do it, that all things were possible,” said Dr. Campo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He struggled with his Latino identity growing up; not until he started teaching at a community college did he see saw the power of being an educator and the influence he could have on Latino students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I had this feeling that ellos son sus hijos, these are your children — that was a shift for me,” said Dr. Campo about his calling. “These children, they were my neighbor and I had this duty to them and to God. [God] said you will serve me through them, and express your love for me through your love for them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges in higher education, Dr. Campo went on to explain during his conversation with Coleman, is that Latino faculty members willfully do not enter into their institution’s administrations because they want to stay connected to students. The last thing Dr. Campo wanted was to go what he called “the dark side” and become an administrator, but he soon realized that by becoming a college president he would have more opportunities to enact positive change for his Latino students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Dr. Campo wanted to send a message to educators in the audience about their expectations of Latino students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think too often we compromise and say, ‘This is good enough.’ Truly that has been the story of the Latino community for too long in this country,” he explained. “We have to be the ones to say no, never settle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is nothing that feels better than preparing students for college and for life,” Dr. Campo closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Preparing Latino Students for College and for Life &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

As participants in the NYC Department of Education’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://schools.nyc.gov/Offices/mediarelations/NewsandSpeeches/2015-2016/Arts+Matters.htm&quot;&gt;Arts Matter&lt;/a&gt; initiative, these public school principals, teachers, and coordinators build robust arts programs in historically under-served schools throughout the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman opened his remarks with the words of legendary dancer and choreographer Martha Graham. “I believe that we learn by practice,” Coleman said, invoking Graham’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://thisibelieve.org/essay/16583/&quot;&gt;This I Believe&lt;/a&gt;” essay, and described how artists endure difficult, focused, sometimes even painful practice to make great work. They get frustrated, they fail. They iterate often. They revise over and over again. And yet through these efforts, they find beauty, grace, and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But what does this activity of the soul have to do with the College Board?” Coleman asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board’s commitment to arts reverberates through its Advanced Placement arts programs. In 2015, more than 80,000 students took AP art exams, in subjects ranging from art history to studio art to music theory. And it was the community of educators around these students, said Coleman, that enabled them to excel — giving them space to express themselves, to make and revise work, to practice, to assemble strong portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is only one force that has changed student performance at scale in this country, and that is a great teacher,” Coleman declared. “The only technology we know that can really help our students grow is teachers like you.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, he admitted, the College Board has to do more. It is simply not enough to offer AP arts courses — we must also provide equal access to the tools that make high-quality arts instruction and learning possible. “We must make the tools of practice free,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, Coleman was pleased to share information about the College Board’s collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://smarthistory.org/&quot;&gt;Smarthistory&lt;/a&gt;, an online multimedia resource for the study of art and cultural heritage. As of this year, Smarthistory has more than 200 vetted contributors (art historians, archeologists, curators, and academics) and features more than 1,500 essays and videos. This content is freely available to a global audience, and it delves into nearly all of the works covered in the AP Art History course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the College Board celebrated the arts during the second annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/academic/winners-second-atlantic-and-college-board-writing-prize-contest&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; College Board Writing Prize&lt;/a&gt;. This year’s contest asked high school students to submit essays that insightfully analyzed and interpreted a work of art that made an impression on them. Over 2,000 students from 43 countries submitted essays on more than 700 paintings, sculptures, and drawings. The award-winning essays, Coleman said, highlighted both the power and the importance of students being able to express their understanding of artistic works through writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For students to be recognized for their work in the arts,” he said, “they must be able to write about them.” By coupling arts instruction and writing instruction, arts teachers best position their students to thoughtfully engage with — and show their aptitude in — the arts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To close his keynote, Coleman made one point clear: “There’s no doubt arts education is important and beneficial for college and career readiness. The College Board speaks to schools all across the country to make sure the arts have their rightful place. But I think we as educators have to pause. We need to confess and declare that education is not just about preparing for college and careers. It is a soul craft.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the arts teachers present, he continued: “The work you do every day with your students surpasses the values of this earth — it moves into deep questions about how fully students live their lives and how fully they can express their deepest experiences. At the College Board we believe those values are essential, they are worth investing in, and they are deeply valuable to students’ futures — inside and outside the classroom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;The Arts Matter&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>11 Ways to Clear a Path to Opportunity</title>

The group shared the stage with Governor Jeb Bush and New Mexico Secretary of Education Hanna Skandera at the 2016 National Summit on Education Reform, hosted by the Foundation for Excellence in Education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman’s remarks began with a reminder that the College Board was founded more than 100 years ago on the idea that merit, not privilege, should determine access to higher education. He opened: “I think if the College Board is to be useful to this country, we must now rededicate ourselves to our original mission. We must dedicate ourselves once again to clearing a path for all students to own their future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then outlined the 11 principles guiding the College Board’s work as we go beyond tests to provide more opportunities to students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen on &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/user-374143842/11-ways-to-clear-a-path-to-opportunity-remarks-by-david-coleman&quot;&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make the SAT more than fair.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The redesigned SAT is making it easier for students to show their best work. How? Gone is the guessing penalty, and gone are obscure “SAT words.” Coleman explained: “The words on the exam are no longer words we use most rarely, but words [students] will use most often in the first year of college.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also noted that there’s now 43 percent more time per question on the SAT than the ACT. “One of the worst things assessment has done in this country is to confuse quick and smart,” Coleman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It&#039;s time to make excellence easier,” he continued. “We want the SAT to be the easiest place for students to show their power, to do their best work. We’re inviting all students—they&#039;ve all got a shot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never give someone only one chance to be great.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coleman described how the redesigned Suite of Assessments—including the PSAT 8/9, PSAT 10, and PSAT/NMSQT—creates a multi-year trajectory, allowing students to see how they’re doing throughout high school. A student’s fate never rests on one test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also clarified: “The PSAT does not predict what you will get on the SAT. No test can tell you your potential… All a test can do is invite you to what you could become, through practice.” He called the PSAT “an invitation to free practice.” Which leads to the next principle—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make practice free for all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent costly test preparation from acting as a barrier to student success on the SAT, the College Board partnered with Khan Academy; together we made high-quality SAT practice free to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of December, 2.5 million students are using Official SAT Practice with Khan Academy, at roughly equal rates—across all income levels, races, and ethnicities. And “there are five times as many students practicing on Khan Academy than all of commercial test preparation combined,” announced Coleman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Practice is an ‘equal opportunity employer,” he said. “Practice works. You can indeed get better at anything if you follow your love and practice.” The two students who joined Coleman and Khan on-stage—who both improved their SAT scores by more than 100 points after using Official SAT Practice—were inspiring testaments to this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fulfill the broken promises of assessment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coleman explained the College Board’s commitment to tracking “opportunities delivered, not just test scores.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though assessments have at best been seen as a way to find “diamonds in the rough and catapult them into opportunity,” the reality is less heartening. Coleman gave the example of students who were in the top ten percent of SAT scorers but the bottom quarter of our nation&#039;s income; despite high test scores, more than half of them do not apply to a single selective college. So the College Board removed a barrier: we worked with our member institutions, and we now give every low-income student who takes the SAT four fee waivers to apply to college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman shared one success story from this initiative: “My favorite moment on the job so far has been when a student posted a picture of his fee waivers on Instagram and said, ‘The College Board sent me fee waivers because I am awesome.’ He did not say, ‘Because I am poor.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End the war between college and career. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;When redesigning the SAT, the College Board worked not only with educators, but with employers. We can’t ask students to work toward college without showing them how they are progressing to careers, said Coleman.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, he shared a new career exploration tool, &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegeboard.roadtripnation.com/&quot;&gt;Roadmap to Careers&lt;/a&gt;, powered by the College Board and Roadtrip Nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prepare a more diverse set of students for STEM fields and degrees specifically, the College Board has also partnered with Project Lead the Way and has launched a new computer science course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/stem/computer-science-principles?excmpid=MTG272-PR-1-prt&quot;&gt;AP Computer Science Principles&lt;/a&gt; (AP CSP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credit is earned, not given. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an American Enterprise Institute report, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aei.org/publication/ap-at-scale-public-school-students-in-advanced-placement-1990-2013/&quot;&gt;AP at Scale: Public school students in Advanced Placement, 1990-2013&lt;/a&gt;,” researcher Nat Malkus points out that while AP participation has increased over the years, neither test scores nor rigor have dropped. “Expanding at scale without sacrificing rigor is the rarest kind of success in public education,” Malkus wrote, “and AP is showing just that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Coleman celebrated the success of AP students and this program, he added: “We have an obligation to be honest with young people and their families before college”—to never give students credits when they haven’t earned it, and to never lead student to believe they’re ready for college-level work if they aren’t. “That’s not a fair bargain for anybody,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No longer allow economies of scale to neglect rural America.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Coleman was happy to announce that more than 2,000 high schools in America signed up for AP Computer Science Principles this year, he stressed the importance of expanding access in &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; kinds of communities— especially in often-overlooked rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through partnerships with &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.org&quot;&gt;Code.org&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pltw.org/our-programs/pltw-computer-science&quot;&gt;Project Lead the Way&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/academic/new-ap-computer-science-principles-course-prominent-computer-science&quot;&gt;National Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, the College Board is offering high-quality computer science curriculum and professional development all across the country, with the goal of implementing AP CSP in every high school in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education is soul craft.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;When we’ve talked about college and career,” said Coleman, “I think we may have forgotten an ancient thing. Education is a precious thing; it involves the life of the soul.”  He described the “gifts” religious education in particular can instill in our students, such as “productive solitude” in an age when “the technology of interruption has far outpaced the technology of concentration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge matters in civic education.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coleman referred to civic education as “the soul of our country—the place for students to get engaged in the world.” He cited the College Board’s new &lt;a href=&quot;https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-united-states-government-and-politics/course&quot;&gt;AP Government and Politics&lt;/a&gt; course as a lively framework, where students deeply study the Constitution, the separation of powers, civil liberties, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End the insanity around the admissions process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since becoming president of the College Board, Coleman has been struck by “the unproductive anxiety that harries children and families throughout the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He encouraged students to focus, in a sustained way, on the few extracurriculars that are most meaningful to them, rather than fill up lines on their college applications with disconnected acitivites. Families, high schools, and colleges alike “need to allow more time for family, faith, and fun,” said Coleman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;11&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parents and families must come first.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;By redesigning score reports, providing additional fee waivers, increasing scholarships, and increasing access for students from military families, the College Board wants to be a partner to students and the caring adults in their lives. “We are redesigning everything we do to give families everything they need in one click,” said Coleman.  &lt;/p&gt;

At the event, they also highlighted the City’s AP for All Initiative, first announced in 2015, to ensure that 75 percent of high school students will have access to at least five AP classes by fall 2018 and all high school students will have access by fall 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EzV0_Z8_4Ls? autoplay=0&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the event, Coleman highlighted how New York City’s leadership is “blazing a path for the country, demonstrating how equity and excellence can both be improved together.” He added: “Diversity and excellence can and must go hand in hand. New York’s impressive AP results reinforce a pattern the College Board has seen nationally. The AP Program has grown by one million students over the last 10 years. A researcher from the American Enterprise Institute found that during that period quality was in no way diminished despite the radical advance in access. He calls it the &#039;the single happiest education story of the century.&#039;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sSvk0ufaogA?autoplay=0&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of students taking at least one AP exam rose 8.4 percent from 41,419 to 44,906 students, and the number of students scoring 3 or higher on AP exams rose 8.2 percent. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/026-17/mayor-de-blasio-chancellor-fari-a-highest-ever-number-nyc-students-taking-and&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find out more about the announcement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are shaking the foundation of this system by putting rigorous AP courses in every neighborhood in every borough,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/026-17/mayor-de-blasio-chancellor-fari-a-highest-ever-number-nyc-students-taking-and&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;statement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “By providing the coursework needed for college and careers for all New York City students, we are sending a message that we believe in them and support them on the path to success. The increases in participation and performance we see today – particularly among Black and Hispanic students – show that we’re moving in the direction of equity and excellence, and I look forward to the work ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, we spoke to Kayla Brathwaite, a New York 12th grader who attends East Park High School in Manhattan. Kayla took three AP classes, and even though she hated studying, she loved to learn. She said if you take AP, you&#039;ll be smarter. Kayla&#039;s teacher saw potential in her and signed her up for an AP class. That&#039;s what AP for All is all about, every student with promise should have access to AP, even when they don&#039;t see potential in themselves. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w9pcqagQhU&quot;&gt;Find out more about Kayla&#039;s journey into AP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of AP are real for Medgar Evers Preparatory High School senior Isaiah Mondesir, who has taken eight AP courses already. “The classes were more challenging and helped me push me further,” says Isaiah. “Prior to taking AP, I wasn’t such a critical thinker as I am now.” He says taking AP also helped him define what he wanted to study in college, which is computer science or Sabre security engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Akwasi Agyeman, taking AP has meant a huge boost in confidence. This senior, who is also at Medgar Evers, says before taking AP he was not academically strong, but now “it makes me feel I can do anything.” He is going to Middlebury College on a full scholarship and hopes to delve into the medical or education field. He feels AP “really helped him step outside his comfort zone and think outside the box.” For his AP classes he learned to research topics on the internet and in the library, and to reach out to strangers for more information – all things he was not comfortable doing before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emmy Delormes, a sophomore at the same school, who has taken four AP courses and is taking four more courses, says AP has opened many doors for her. “For some, college seems so far away. Like an impossible dream. AP&#039;s make that dream possible as it helps students develop certain study skills and assets that will be highly beneficial in college.” &lt;/p&gt;
