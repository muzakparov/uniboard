The American Indian Graduate Center and American Indian Graduate Center Scholars (AIGC and AIGCS), Asian &amp;amp; Pacific Islander American Scholarship Fund (APIASF), Hispanic Scholarship Fund (HSF), Jack Kent Cooke Foundation (JKCF), and the United Negro College&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fund (UNCF) will use information from the PSAT/NMSQT&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to expand access to nearly $180 million in existing scholarship dollars to low-income and minority students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PSAT/NMSQT information will allow AIGC and AIGCS, APIASF, HSF, the JKCF, and UNCF to reach a better representation of high school students across the country who may not have otherwise been aware they were eligible for scholarship opportunities. Outreach will begin with students from the class of 2015 who have taken the PSAT/NMSQT during high school and opted in to receive materials from scholarship providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PSAT/NMSQT is the nation’s largest and most representative precollege assessment. In October 2014, a record 3.8 million students took the exam. As a result of the College Board’s ongoing efforts to expand access to the PSAT/NMSQT to a broader group of students, 77 percent (897,567) of minority students who graduated from public high schools in 2014 took the PSAT/NMSQT at least once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement reinforces the College Board’s commitment to making assessments a platform for delivering opportunity. These new partnerships, combined with the College Board’s long-standing partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalmerit.org/&quot;&gt;National Merit Scholarship Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (NMSC), create a portfolio of opportunities that reach every major segment of students. The scholarships will now range from programs focused purely on academic merit, to those available to students who meet specific financial, racial, ethnic, and other eligibility requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What this country needs is not more tests but more opportunities,” said David Coleman, president and CEO of the College Board. “The 3.8 million students who already take the PSAT/NMSQT will now gain access to nearly $180 million more in scholarships, early enough in their high school careers to change their futures. These partnerships complement our work with National Merit Scholarship Corporation, and further remove barriers to college and career success for students across the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the College Board launched a redesign of the PSAT/NMSQT. Like the redesigned SAT, the redesigned PSAT/NMSQT will be focused on the skills and knowledge evidence shows is necessary for success in college and career. The first administration of the exam will take place in October 2015.  In addition to scholarship opportunities, additional benefits of the current and redesigned PSAT/NMSQT include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Practice for the SAT;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A mid-high school check on whether a student is on target for college and career readiness;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detailed performance feedback and suggestions for how students can improve their readiness for college and career, including free, personalized SAT practice through Khan Academy;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Access to challenging course work by identifying students’ potential to succeed in Advanced Placement courses; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Access to free college and career planning resources such as Student Search Service®, My College QuickStart™, and BigFuture™.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Statements from the New Partners&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P. “Sam” Deloria, Director, AIGC&lt;/strong&gt;: “Since our founding, AIGC and AIGCS have been driven by a commitment to expand the number of American Indians  who earn professional degrees. We recognize how critical financial support is to ensuring students can pursue postsecondary opportunities, and working with the College Board allows us to reach a broader group of American Indian students who can take advantage of the scholarships we offer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neil Horikoshi, President and Executive Director, APIASF&lt;/strong&gt;: “Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) students are often left out of the conversation when it comes to intervention for college access and success. We are thankful for partners like the College Board, who recognize the need and are helping us inform AAPI students about resources they have to pursue a college education.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fidel A. Vargas, President and CEO, HSF&lt;/strong&gt;: “Our goal is to provide students all the tools they need to apply to college, do well in their course work, graduate, enter a profession, excel, help lead our nation going forward, and mentor the generations to come. Working with the College Board is yet another way we will be able to further our goals and help Latino students make successful transitions to college.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harold O. Levy, Executive Director, JKCF: &lt;/strong&gt;“The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation awards annual scholarships of up to $40,000 to high-performing students with financial need. By partnering with the College Board, we are able to engage a broader universe of high-achieving, low-income students that have the ability to excel when given the resources to develop their talents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael L. Lomax, President and CEO, UNCF&lt;/strong&gt;: “For 70 years, UNCF has worked to help students get to and through college. Partnering with the College Board will allow us to further expand our reach to African American students across the country who will benefit from being able to access the scholarships and resources we are prepared to provide.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Starbucks Serves Its Students</title>

Thanks to the Starbucks College Achievement Plan, they can now earn a bachelor’s degree online through Arizona State University (ASU) — with full tuition reimbursement for all four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starbucks chose ASU not only because of its innovative online platform, but also because of the high-quality education and support it could offer. Students have access to dedicated coaches, advisors, and tutors, professors who teach on ASU’s campus, and can choose from more than 60 online degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Access spoke with Mary Dixon, director of partner resources – Starbucks College Achievement Plan, to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Access: What inspired Starbucks to invest in its employees in this way? Why is education a top priority for the company?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Dixon: We know that investing in our partners (employees) is the best investment we can make. The Starbucks experience comes to life through our partners. When our partners are engaged, the result is deeper customer connections, and that’s good business — we are successful one partner, one customer at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we began looking at the next way we could invest in our partners’ experience and create better pathways to opportunity, our partners told us they wanted to finish college but couldn’t because of the financial challenges that were standing in their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that more than 70 percent of our partners have not finished their bachelor’s degrees, we wanted to help. So in 2014 we launched the Starbucks College Achievement Plan in partnership with Arizona State University (ASU).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: What have you learned from the partners who have participated in the program so far? Has it changed the culture of the company? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MD: After launching the program in 2014, we learned quickly from our partners that our original structure for the program was too complicated. We listened and expanded the program in early 2015 to include all four years of college (it was originally just the last two) and make the reimbursement process easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’re seeing more than 60 percent of our new hires are interested in the program. And we’ve learned that partners enrolled in ASU retain 40 percent higher than our core U.S. retail population, and they are four times more likely to get promoted and take on greater responsibilities.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: Can you share some of your favorite success stories? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MD: There are so many great stories that we hear every day, from partners who didn’t think they could finish their degree (or ever start one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michelle, a single mom, returned to school to finish her degree and has inspired her daughter to go to college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony, who wants to pursue journalism and film-making, and is the first in his family to graduate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every one of the more than 6,000 Starbucks College Achievement Plan current participants —   and every one of the more than 200 graduates — has a unique story. The program continues to grow and show us how investing in our people can lead to great things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: What advice or inspiration would you give to other companies that are considering similar investments? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MD: Talk with your employees — they are the inspiration. Ask: what is most meaningful to them? What are the values of your organization? Take a chance to do something differently. Find a great partner, like we did with Arizona State University. A strong partnership pushes you to do even more, and you both bring your specific expertise to the table. The combined efforts only help make the program better for your employees.&lt;/p&gt;
