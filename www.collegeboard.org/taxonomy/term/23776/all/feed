Yes — but only if there&#039;s a human hand to help guide it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a major takeaway from &quot;Beyond the Red Pen: Automated Writing Evaluation Tools,&quot; a Thursday morning session at the 2016 Northeastern Regional Forum in Boston. Led by Doug Waugh, executive director of SpringBoard Product Management, and Tim Marks, senior program manager for the College Board&#039;s Automated Essay Evaluation Program, the session provided an in-depth look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://turnitin.com/en_us/what-we-offer/revision-assistant&quot;&gt;Revision Assistant&lt;/a&gt;, a new offering from &lt;a href=&quot;http://turnitin.com/&quot;&gt;Turnitin&lt;/a&gt; that provides student writers with constant feedback and suggestions about how they can improve their work through meaningful practice and revision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&#039;s not science fiction,&quot; Marks said of the futuristic-sounding technology, which is currently available for use in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://springboard.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;English Language Arts curriculum of SpringBoard&lt;/a&gt;. The tool is able to support students and teachers because of all the developmental work that goes on at the front end of the process. “Grounding everything in the human process is key to what we do,” Marks said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revision Assistant works on an algorithm similar to those used by Pandora and Netflix to build their customer recommendations and is informed by teacher input every step of the way. SpringBoard teachers participate in group evaluation and scoring sessions of student essays — much like the AP Readings — to provide the tool with a blueprint from which it begins to learn and recognize the hallmarks of good writing. Teachers also help build the prompts, rubrics, and scoring criteria that are incorporated into Revision Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpringBoard teachers are encouraged to share the prompts and scoring criteria with their students before they begin writing to help them better understand the goals and expectations of a performance task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The transparency gained from previewing the assignment can help students really get a sense of what they can and need to do to score well,” Waugh said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As students being drafting their essays, Revision Assistant generates feedback by comparing traits from their current assignment against those in previously scored essays, which allows the tool to notice trends in a given student’s use of language, essay structure, and expression of ideas. The feedback comments are displayed in pop-up windows alongside the students’ essays, so they can adjust in real time as they compose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://i1054.photobucket.com/albums/s490/uvasig/NERO%20session%20-%20teacher%20scoring_zpsm9hqagwj.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height:300px; width:400px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Session attendees engage in an essay-scoring demonstration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Revision Assistant gives students a large degree of autonomy on what do with that feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The display comments offer suggestions,” Marks said. “How to improve is left to the student; the feedback is designed to help them think through the writing process. When [an essay] gets to a teacher, the idea is that a student will have considered the elements needed to produce a good essay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waugh said that SpringBoard teachers and students are enjoying the benefits of Revision Assistant. Because the tool allows for the unlimited submission of drafts, students can engage in thoughtful practice that gives them constant feedback on their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They like to lean over and see their classmates’ signal checks to see how they’re doing,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For teachers, Revision Assistant helps them see the progression of their students’ writing over time, which can help them track improvement and offer more targeted coaching during one-on-one editing sessions. They also have the opportunity to grow professionally as graders by participating in the group scoring and norming sessions with other educators.&lt;/p&gt;
