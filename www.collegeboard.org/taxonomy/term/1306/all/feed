&lt;p&gt;This is my first year attending Forum. I came mainly to network and to gain more knowledge about what’s going on in Higher Education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What sessions are you most looking forward to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breakfast. Just kidding! I’m really looking forward to “Boosting Success Among Young Men of Color” and “The Gender Gap in Higher Ed: Context, Causes, and Campus-Based Responses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high school I was that underrepresented kid. I went to a high school with a lot of other kids like me and no college recruiter ever visited us to tell us what our options were, or help us take the next step. I started my work in higher education because I wanted to give back; to give these kids a fair chance and make it equal on all levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s one thing you’ve learned so far?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just got here, actually. I was working this morning, doing an on-campus visit and meeting with 40 students. I’m looking forward to everything I will learn over the next few days!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will you take what you’ve learned at Forum and use it in your daily work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m eager to learn things I can really apply to my daily work; knowledge and tactics I can use to help get more kids where they need to be in terms of college access and success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Overheard at Forum: Andre Lawson, Admissions and Recruitment Coordinator at the University of Nevada-Reno&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;Trends in Higher Education&lt;/a&gt; series provides insight into national trends in college pricing and financial aid. The data on college prices and student aid included in these reports create a context for evaluating public policies designed to increase educational opportunities. Below are key findings from the reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandy Baum, research professor of education policy at the George Washington University Graduate School of Education &amp;amp; Human Development, senior fellow at the Urban Institute, and co-author of the 2014 Trends in Higher Education reports, will host a webinar for members on &lt;strong&gt;Thursday, Dec. 4, at 1–2 p.m&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; This webinar will include information about the results of both reports and discuss the implications for higher education and student aid moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://collegeboardtraining.webex.com/collegeboardtraining/onstage/g.php?MTID=eb87882e560855d28b66d96cd3283a63d&quot;&gt;Register&lt;/a&gt; for the webinar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Print versions of the report will be available at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://regionalforums.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;2015 Regional Forums&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Key Tuition and Fee Findings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Average published tuition and fees for full-time in-state students at public four-year colleges and universities increased 2.9%, rising from $8,885 in 2013-14 to $9,139 in 2014-15.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Average published tuition and fees for full-time out-of-state students at public four-year colleges and universities increased 3.3%, rising from $22,223 in 2013-14 to $22,958 in 2014-15.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Average published tuition and fees at private nonprofit four-year institutions increased 3.7%, rising from $30,131 in 2013-14 to $31,231 in 2014-15.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Average published in-district tuition and fees at public two-year colleges increased 3.3%, rising from $3,241 in 2013-14 to $3,347 in 2014-15.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Average net prices are much lower than published prices because many students benefit from grant aid from federal and state governments, colleges and universities, and other sources, as well as from federal education tax credits and deductions. Over the decade from 2004-05 to 2014-15, average net tuition and fees at public four-year institutions rose by 32%, compared to a 42% increase in the published price (after adjusting for inflation). At private nonprofit four-year institutions, the average net price fell by 13% over the decade, while the average published price increased by 24%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2014-15, full-time students receive an average of about $6,110 in grant aid and education tax benefits at public four-year institutions, $5,090 at public two-year colleges, and $18,870 at private nonprofit four-year institutions to help them pay the published prices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Key Student Aid Findings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Undergraduates received an average of $14,180 in financial aid in 2013-14, including $8,080 in grants from all sources, $4,840 in federal loans, $1,195 in education tax credits and deductions, and $65 in Federal Work-Study.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Total annual education borrowing fell by an estimated 8% in real terms between 2012-13 and 2013-14, following declines of 4% and 2% in the two preceding years, leading to a three-year decline of 13%.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2013-14, undergraduate borrowers took federal Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans averaging $6,670, over $300 less (in 2013 dollars) than the year before and $740 less than in 2010-11.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Total borrowing from the federal direct subsidized and unsubsidized loan programs fell by an estimated 10% ($8.7 billion in 2013 dollars) in 2013-14, and by 18% between 2010-11 and 2013-14. Total borrowing under the Parent PLUS program fell by 1% ($58 million) in 2013-14 and by 12% over three years; and the Grad PLUS program provided 4% ($276 million) less in 2013-14 than in the preceding year and 1% more than in 2010-11.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2013, 40% of borrowers with outstanding education debt owed less than $10,000, and another 29% owed between $10,000 and $24,999; 4% of borrowers owed $100,000 or more. This debt includes borrowing for both undergraduate and graduate studies.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grant aid per full-time equivalent undergraduate student increased by 39% between 2007-08 and 2010-11 and by 8% between 2010-11 and 2013-14.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The number of students receiving Pell Grants — the central federal grant program providing funding for low- and moderate-income students — increased from 3.8 million in 1993-94 to 5.1 million in 2003-04, and to 9.2 million in 2013-14. The percentage of undergraduate students receiving Pell Grants increased from 25% in 2003-04 to 38% in 2013-14.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;Trends in Higher Education&lt;/a&gt; reports were written by College Board Policy Research Scientist Jennifer Ma, and Sandy Baum, research professor of education policy at the George Washington University Graduate School of Human Development, with assistance from College Board Research Statistician D’Wayne Bell and Diane Cardenas Elliott.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College Board Releases the 2014 Trends in Higher Education Reports&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The Colloquium is a gathering of professionals at all levels of higher education to discuss the topics and issues that matter most to them and their students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luna, a first generation college student, kicked off the conversations for the next two days with a keynote address that focused on what public education means to the common good. At a time when policy makers and the general public alike are questioning the value of higher education, Luna described the imperative of all higher education stakeholders to disseminate a common understanding that education is the key to choice, independence, and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He challenged participants to consider the following question: Does higher education as a holistic institution truly care about all students?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Colloquium, attendees will bring this question to bear as they discuss the most salient issues in higher education right now—including how college costs are affecting the middle class, communications strategies around the value of a college education, and the debate surrounding college rankings and ratings systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luna’s own college experience continues to inform his work to this day. He shared anecdotes about his time as an undergraduate at Stanford, which was not without setbacks. His message that the shifting demographics of this country necessitate a continuous shift in the approach of higher education institutions to serving and supporting all students set the tone for the next few days, and energized participants to prepare for these tough conversations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Paul Luna Challenges Colloquium 2015 Participants to Rethink their Approach to Serving All Students &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I attended last year and learned an enormous amount. I think it’s a great opportunity to get reenergized about the core of what we do. Over the course of the year we get caught up in the semantics of our day to day jobs and it’s wonderful to be reminded of the purpose and mission of our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We just heard from panelists about the importance of communicating about the price of college. As a financial aid professional, talk about your reaction to &lt;a href=&quot;https://colloquium.collegeboard.org/program&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this session&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m surprised by how infrequently communications comes up in terms of student aid access. I was also surprised by how much frustration there is around aid communications, but I understand why it exists, especially when you look at the resources colleges devote to admissions communications, or policy maker communications. It’s striking to think that aid officers feel so badly under-resourced in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we feel like it is somehow crass to message around aid, but the reality is, it’s a public service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools that do cost communications best, in terms of ease of use and presentation, are for-profit institutions and tuition-dependent small colleges, and that’s because they have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially for those of us at an institution with a public service mission as a core part of our identity, we have to start looking at aid communications in that context. Done right, it’s a service to students and families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you end up working in higher education?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to work for Shirley Ort, who is one of the true believers in the core mission of higher education. I met Shirley when I was a student journalist at UNC and she was one of the most consistently open and helpful people in higher ed. I was lucky enough to work with her on some one-off projects after graduation, and now I get to work with her full time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working for Shirley has been a great chance to learn the ins and outs of a very complicated an increasingly important corner of higher ed—and there was no way I was going to miss out on that chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you had a piece of advice or encouragement for someone thinking about pursuing a career in higher education, particularly in the financial aid arena, what would it be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial aid is the most fascinating areas of public policy to me. It is one of the most complex and politically contentious public benefits and in that sense it is a great place to gain experience to pursue a career in politics, public affairs, economics—it is widely applicable no matter where you see your career going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s valuable about Colloquium, in particular, compared to other higher education conferences?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colloquium is much more conversational, and a little rawer than most higher education conferences I’ve been to. In that sense, it’s more productive. I would say there is more honesty in the way people are talking to each other, and I hope some of that spills over into our public discussions of these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Overheard at Colloquium: Attendee Eric Johnson Talks Communications and Financial Aid&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;That was the overarching message participants at the Higher Ed Colloquium received from the “Conversation with Presidents” that opened the first full day of events On January 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in Delray Beach, FL. Following Paul Luna’s keynote the previous evening, during which he challenged the audience of higher education professionals to address the needs of &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; students, the session invited a careful and critical look into how individual student populations may influence institutional policy and culture rather than the other way around. Catharine Bond Hill, Wallace D. Loh, and Michael A. Sorrell, presidents of Vassar College, the University of Maryland, and Paul Quinn College, respectively, each offered ideas and advice that, though sometimes seemingly at odds, have contributed significantly to the success of their particular institution – success defined largely by their ability to produce graduates who are both employable and civic-minded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Montoya, the College Board’s vice president for higher education and international outreach, asked the panel a broad but daunting question: “How do colleges and universities need to step it up?”  It turns out that the different answers the presidents gave were shaped by a shared goal: to do what is best for the communities they serve.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For President Sorrell, that means placing a very conscious effort on confronting the issues that most directly affect the low-income students in his care.  And in their case, he says, their lives will be changed most by changing the urban environment in which they live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve decided to marry education with the public good, treat it as its own educational endeavor,” said Sorrell. “The public good occurs when you actually weigh into the issues and solve them. The needs of the community supersede the individual.”  As an example, Sorrell highlighted the dismantling of Paul Quinn’s football program and the transformation of its football field into an organic urban farm that now serves the local community, otherwise classified as a food desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation and entrepreneurship for the sake of the public good was also a theme of President Loh’s remarks. Loh likewise singled out a nutrition-related project at the University of Maryland, the Food Recovery Network, which provides food that would otherwise go to waste to people in need. But innovation and entrepreneurship should be the watchwords of the university, said Loh, primarily to solve “the biggest issue of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century: jobs, jobs, jobs.” At a large economically diverse institution like the University of Maryland, he argued, it is imperative to conceive of ways to educate everyone better, and at a lower cost for the more financially strapped. “Why are the low income students subsidizing the wealthy?” he asked. “I think we should raise tuition to help the low income students. Institutions must have autonomy [to make these decisions].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Hill warned that increasing income inequality will lead to problems greater than personal student debt. The likelihood that students from low income families will have access to educational opportunity at all, she said, is becoming ever more doubtful.  As a result, “I think we’ll see social stresses that will make this a country we don’t want to live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How can we make sure higher ed is part of the solution, and not reinforcing societal problems?” Hill asked.  “How do we frame this argument at the local level to get our states to reinvest in our students education as part of the public good?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hill agreed that serving one’s students and serving the larger good are not mutually exclusive, and, in fact, that you can’t do one without the other. “We have on obligation, even as a private institution, to serve the public interest,” she said.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College and University Presidents Discuss Higher Ed’s Role in Serving the Public Good&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>Mary Beth Marks and Robert Hogeda Make their Mark on the Southwest Region</title>

Together, they’re a dream team that is quietly shaping the future of the Southwestern Region. Intrigued? So were we. All Access chatted with Robert and Mary Beth to see what exactly makes their working relationship so special, and why it’s good for Sul Ross State, the College Board and, most important, students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Access: First, talk a bit about your day job. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mary Beth Marks: &lt;/strong&gt;A basic day for me is talking to recruiters, looking at enrollment trends, finding prospective students, setting up communications campaigns, and working with other university stakeholders to set goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hogeda:&lt;/strong&gt; My daily routine is anything but routine — I think of myself as a dream enabler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: That sounds like the best job ever. Can you expand on that a bit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RH:&lt;/strong&gt; My goal is to match up students who want to pursue postsecondary education with colleges and universities that meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: Mary Beth, how often do you interact with the College Board in general?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MBM: &lt;/strong&gt;I didn’t really interact with the College Board until I met Robert at a TACRAO conference. We didn’t know anything about each other. We just had to meet in the crowd, blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RH:&lt;/strong&gt; It was cryptic — we agreed to “meet in the hallway.” I knew she was a woman; that was about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MBM:&lt;/strong&gt; At the time, Sul Ross really wasn’t doing any prospecting with the College Board, so the vice president set it up for me to meet with Robert, and I got the chance to ask him questions about trends and tips on recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there we had some phone calls about recruiting strategies. Robert gave me feedback. It wasn’t just prospective name buying, but more about getting his expertise on what would work for Sul Ross because I wasn’t familiar with this type of recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: And that’s how you got involved on the Southwestern Regional Council?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MBM:&lt;/strong&gt; Not really. First I was nominated — by Robert — for the College Board Enrollment Leadership Academy. That year I met with reps from the College Board at least once a quarter, did College Board webinars, and attended the College Board Forum. I approached Robert about how I could get involved with the regional council, and he helped with that process. I interacted with regional members at the Forum to enhance my prospects for being nominated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, Robert came out to do presentations for our staff and regional high school counselors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RH:&lt;/strong&gt; It was a Redesigned SAT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;/PSAT/NMSQT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; workshop — the first collaboration between&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K–12 and higher ed in the region regarding the rSAT. It turned out really well. The rural high school counselors and university TRIO staff who attended reacted very positively to the enhancements for the exams. The turnout at the workshop was remarkable in and of itself because the morning of the event there was an ice storm, so many districts opened late. Yet most everyone still drove in, some from as far as 3 hours away. We only had three school districts not participate out of 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: What were the results of that meeting? What did you learn?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RH:&lt;/strong&gt; We got really wonderful questions, many indicating a renewed interest in the PSAT/NMSQT and SAT. Mary Beth sincerely cared about making sure the high schools were informed, and we’re looking to do more of these events to truly promote our initiatives in that rural area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MBM:&lt;/strong&gt; From my perspective, having the College Board come out and talk to counselors. — getting their buy-in — was really important. The Khan Academy test-prep information was great, as was getting the counselors to talk to College Board representatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: Mary Beth, did this meeting change the nature of your relationship with Robert?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MBM:&lt;/strong&gt; I feel now like I can contact anybody, but I always start with Robert because he’s not just College Board, he’s my friend. That was sweet, wasn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RH:&lt;/strong&gt; It was. It’s a genuine relationship that I believe really fosters itself because we bounce ideas off each other, and we can be frank with each other if the situation requires that. Mary Beth holds her own in meetings with regional council members and senior staff, so she’s able to speak up for her institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the reasons I nominated her for the regional council; she’s not just going to be an attendee, she’s an active participant, which is what we need — folks that are going to make a change for the better, not just a “yes” person. Mary Beth is definitely the former.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MBM:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s a nice way of putting it — he tells me I’m bossy. It’s interesting: If the College Board hadn’t been talking about redesigning the SAT, I probably wouldn’t be as interested. I don’t know that the current test appropriately represents our students, who are first generation, low income, ESL. That was my impression. The redesign of the SAT really seems geared to help &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; students succeed. Whether these students pick Sul Ross or not, I want these students to be set up for success, and I think the College Board is doing work to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: Is there any specific work — besides the redesign of the SAT — that you plan to focus on as part of the regional council?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MBM:&lt;/strong&gt; The biggest thing I’m really impressed with is Khan Academy. Besides admission and recruiting, I have three TRIO grants that I supervise. Part of the goal for those grants is to get students test-ready. Now that they have the option of Khan Academy for test prep, it will make a really big difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RH: &lt;/strong&gt;What was really enlightening to me and Joshua [Romberg — Robert’s K–12 counterpart] after our presentation, as we took questions and comments from Mary Beth’s staff, was that some folks talked about using their TRIO grant money to offset the cost of the PSAT/NMSQT. This is pertinent — that these people are so excited they are talking about rearranging their budgets to accommodate the PSAT/NMSQT — was a reward in itself. They got it. They see how it’s good for kids, giving them more access to more opportunities, quite frankly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: What advice would you have for your colleagues in higher education to establish or improve their relationship with their College Board educational manager?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MBM:&lt;/strong&gt; If we’re talking about the university-to-College Board relationship, I wonder how many universities even know who their rep is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RH: &lt;/strong&gt;That’s true. I think it’s about the efforts made on both sides. We’re all so busy that we may not be thinking about picking up the phone or sending a quick text. It takes a lot of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MBM:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s not hard effort, like “ugh, I have to call Robert.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RH:&lt;/strong&gt; I hope not! You have to be intentional and responsive toward each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MBM:&lt;/strong&gt; I would have never known that College Board reps are more than just people you get student names from. You can run ideas by them; you can talk about trends; you can talk about ideas. They’re more than just people that are going to help you with your recruitment needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RH:&lt;/strong&gt; From our perspective, we all share the same goal: truly developing the relationship and coming together to do what’s right and what’s best for students and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MBM:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s a good way to put it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Mary Beth Marks and Robert Hogeda Make their Mark on the Southwest Region&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Ericka will lead our overall work in Membership, Governance, and Higher Education, ensuring effective integration and collaboration among these critical divisions. By uniting these teams under Ericka’s leadership, we are better positioned to work together with our members across our constituencies, achieve our goals, and propel students into opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericka brings to the College Board a wealth of experience and a track record of delivering access and opportunity to students. Throughout her career, she has taken on complex, highly visible projects and worked with a range of stakeholders to deliver results. She has managed large teams across many disciplines, including strategic planning, public policy development and advocacy, executive recruitment, and fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericka joins the College Board from the U.S. Department of Education, where she served as Senior Advisor to Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. In that role, she led cross-agency teams working on issues that included higher education funding and grant-making. Prior to her work at the Department, Ericka served as the Vice President for Operations and Strategic Leadership for The Education Trust, a renowned national education nonprofit. As chief operating officer for Ed Trust, she ensured the effective development and implementation of a 10-year strategic plan, led a comprehensive board development process, and guided the organization through a significant period of growth, which included the establishment of a new state office and three supporting organizations. Under her leadership, Ed Trust was recognized as a &lt;em&gt;Great Place to Work&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Washingtonian&lt;/em&gt; magazine. Other previous roles included Vice President and Director at the executive search firm Isaacson, Miller, where she led the K-12 education practice, and the McKenzie Group (now part of American Institutes for Research), where she served as President and COO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericka earned her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University and her master’s and doctoral degrees in English literature from Stanford University. She is a former English professor at Mills College in Oakland where she taught American literature and persuasive writing. Ericka was born and raised in Alexandria, Va., and still considers the T. C. Williams Titans her favorite sports team. She enjoys active travel, community service, and following the teenage adventures of her twin nephews.&lt;/p&gt;

As I stood for almost two hours giving out information to mostly 10th–12th-graders about planning for college, free SAT practice information, and college application fee waivers, I truly felt blessed to work for an organization with such a wonderful mission. At least 300 students and parents showed up at the event hoping to catch the admission and financial aid representatives from MIT, University of Arizona, and Maryland, among many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to several seniors, most of whom had already sent out their applications. One wanted to be a neonatal surgeon, another a journalist — many had clear pictures of what their futures should be.  A few didn’t yet know what they wanted out of college; they came to the event hoping to start figuring that out. The younger students seemed a little suspicious but pleasantly surprised when I kept saying the SAT practice online we offered was free. Parents, for their part, were in disbelief and promised they would make sure their kids took advantage of these free tools, which they had no idea existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the students wanted to go to college but worried about how they were going to find the money to pay for it.  Not surprisingly, the most popular sessions at Ballou that night were on financial aid. Several college representatives said how impressed they were with the engagement from students, who had come from three different schools in the area. Many students asked college representatives for their business cards so they could be in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With College Board Forum 2015 happening in Washington, D.C., it made sense to partner with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dcps.dc.gov/release/dc-public-schools-continues-momentum-fastest-improving-urban-school-district-country&quot;&gt;fastest-improving&lt;/a&gt; urban school district in the country to bring admission and financial aid experts from higher education institutions directly into contact with DCPS students,” said Aaron Lemon-Strauss, executive director at the College Board, who organized and executed the event.  “Colleges and universities are looking for engaged and prepared students, and Ballou, Anacostia, and Woodson high schools in D.C. have hundreds of them, as we saw last night.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though these events are meant to inspire students, I&#039;m happy to say that I, too, left inspired by such smart and driven students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;&amp;#039;Explore College&amp;#039; Night at Ballou High School Gets Rave Reviews by Staff and Students&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They spoke to All Access about why K–12 and higher education partnerships are so valuable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Access: What is the FAFSA Family Night? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deb Thyng Schmidt: &lt;/strong&gt;Longmont High School’s Arriba FAFSA Family Night is a pilot program that takes advantage of the new early availability of the FAFSA. A workshop to get parents to complete the FAFSA at an earlier stage in the process removes a major barrier for our Hispanic students. Financial aid officers from Colorado State University (CSU), including Spanish speakers, lead parents through the process of completing the 2017-18 FAFSA online using Longmont High Chromebooks. To make it possible for more of our parents to attend, we offer childcare through our Arriba student organization and a meal through a local restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: What are the top three goals for the event?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DTS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build on our relationships with parents and work with them on what can be a very intimidating part of the college application process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raise parents’ sights for their students by telling them how financial aid can make college affordable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure that our Hispanic students have a Student Aid Report in hand as they enter the college application process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Biedscheid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be proactive in our work with students and families every chance we get. Help families avoid mistakes on the FAFSA to speed up the process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amplify our efforts to create clear pathways to higher education by coming together. While Longmont High School works to develop relationships with parents, CSU’s Office of Financial Aid works to develop relationships with high school counselors and administrators.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Show, firsthand, how financial aid can eliminate the barrier of the cost of higher education.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: Tell us how this partnership between Longmont High School and CSU came about. What are the benefits of a partnership between K–12 and higher education institutions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DTS: &lt;/strong&gt;Because I was a former writer and consultant for the College Board and familiar with ther programs and services, I expected to find useful resources about the new FAFSA timeline on their website, and I did. I contacted Anne Sturtevant, executive director of higher education at the College Board, and asked if she could recommend staff to help with our FAFSA Night. My request was extended to Tom, and I was delighted that he was enthusiastic about joining us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many benefits of this type of partnership, too many to list. But a major benefit is that parents and students always come away inspired — and their sights raised — by positive exposure to the people who represent higher education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, when students see this type of collaboration, they become more comfortable with the experience they’ll have after high school. College is seen as a natural extension of their intellectual and personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TB: &lt;/strong&gt;The College Board is uniquely positioned to bring K–12 and higher education together in a way that shows how much more effective we can be when we work together. My experience attending College Board events has honestly spilled over into my day-to-day work and is constantly at the top of my mind. When Anne and Deborah reached out to ask me to contribute to Longmont High School’s event, my response was an automatic “yes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: Why is it important to hold an event like this now? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DTS&lt;/strong&gt;: The change to the FAFSA calendar provides the ideal opportunity to get information out to parents in a new way, at an earlier time in the process. We’re always looking for ways to build relationships with parents and students, and the timing is perfect this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TB&lt;/strong&gt;: The early FAFSA adds months to the college and financial aid application process. It gives students much more time to choose an institution that’s the best fit. Creating an earlier opportunity for underrepresented students to leverage the FAFSA change is the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The FAFSA may seem intimidating, but it can be completed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The FAFSA is a crucial first step to enable students to afford college. It’s the primary document for eligibility for need-based and scholarship aid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Concerns about affording college shouldn’t keep students from applying. There’s assistance out there and a process for making college possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Colleges and universities like CSU have staff members ready and willing to share their expertise so that students and their families can afford college.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High schools like Longmont have staff members ready and willing to encourage students to explore postsecondary education and make it happen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Members Host “Arriba FAFSA Family Night” in Colorado&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

A unique opportunity that gathers professionals and leaders in admission, enrollment, and financial aid, the Colloquium provides a forum for many tough discussions about the state of higher education in this country. Topics range from affordability to academic rigor to race relations on campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colloquium 2017, held Jan. 7-9 in Delray Beach, Florida, began under the shroud of a tragedy—a deadly shooting took place at the Fort Lauderdale airport on the day before the event was scheduled to begin. Participants heard from Jim Montoya, College Board’s chief of membership, governance, and global higher education and secretary of the corporation, that the program would proceed as planned. Emotions were strong as those assembled stood in appreciation of one of their own—a Colloquium attendee who survived the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keynoter Terrell Strayhorn from the Ohio State University then drilled down to the crux of what would become a theme throughout the conference: how we as educators and administrators can create environments on campus that support all students—regardless of race, gender, political affiliation, or sexual orientation. The ensuing discussion reflected an ongoing societal dialogue: what more can and should higher ed be doing to ensure their success?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A panel of college presidents carried this conversation forward when they opened Day Two. Jane Fernandes, president of Guilford College, Renu Khator, chancellor of the University of Houston System and president of the University of Houston, and Raynard Kington, president of Grinnell College, shared the challenges and successes they faced on their journeys to becoming college presidents and leaders in the field. Each recounted the winding road that led them to their leadership positions and harkened back to the moment they decided to dedicate their careers to education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernandes introduced the notion of “brave” space, as developed by social justice educators Brian Arao and Kristi Clemens. She described it as a situation or physical place in which students and faculty are not shielded from the opposing viewpoints and conflicting opinions of others, but instead are encouraged to hear them in an informed and respectful manner. This is, after all, the essence of higher education—the ability and willingness to be open to, support, and learn from ideas and opinions on which we may not see eye to eye. As Fernandes said, “I, too, am a student; I’m still learning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Student leaders in the “Race Matters” session echoed this sentiment. They discussed their work to advance racial equality on their campuses by leveraging grassroots organizing tactics, protests, and partnerships among administrators, students, and faculty. While they felt their “brave” spaces were often stifling and counterproductive, each expressed gratitude for the experience and challenge of trying to implement change on a massive scale, especially on campuses rooted in tradition like Mizzou and SUNY Stony Brook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To close the Colloquium, noted researchers Sandy Baum and Jennifer Ma led the “Education Pays” session. They shared new data and made the case for the value of a college education in an age where 61% of bachelor’s degree recipients from public and private nonprofit institutions who borrowed graduated with an average of $28,100 in debt. The conversation that followed was a practical one—how can higher ed adjust to shifting demographics and make what has become a “tough sell” to ensure students really understand and take advantage of the benefits a higher education will afford them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Themes of inequality, race, and cultural bias rang throughout the 2017 Colloquium. These are not easy topics to talk about in casual conversation; much less in a room full of professional peers and colleagues, but one of the objectives of Colloquium is to promote thoughtful discussion in order to solve persistent problems. Participants look to the Colloquium to address these challenges and to leave with greater insight and knowledge to put into practice on their campuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College Board&amp;#039;s 2017 Higher Ed Colloquium Tackles Tough Topics&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What drew you to the College Board?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;I’m drawn to the College Board for a number of reasons. Initially I was drawn to the organization because I have tremendous respect for its influence, reach, and reputation for producing high-quality work. There are many organizations that promote opportunity, access, and success for students as they consider and pursue postsecondary education, but I can’t think of another organization that has the ability to engage so many actors in this effort — students, parents, teachers, counselors, secondary school administrators, college and university administrators and faculty, policymakers — all of whom are critically important when it comes to ensuring that all students acquire the knowledge and skills to succeed in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;I was also drawn to the mission of challenging all students to own their future, because it’s powerful and it rings true. I first encountered the College Board when I was a young person taking the PSAT/NMSQT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, and I remember how meaningful that experience was for me. I grew up with parents who expected me to go to college, but it wasn’t until I took the test that I truly began to own that decision. It wasn’t until that moment that I saw myself as a person preparing for college, and I became acutely aware that what I did from that point on to prepare myself for college mattered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What excites you most about your new role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;I’m excited that it brings together three very important functions — membership, governance, higher education — that are related but have the potential to be more integrated. There’s creative opportunity in that challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;I’m also looking forward to working closely with so many of our external partners — member organizations, Trustees, council members, postsecondary institutions — in our effort to achieve greater educational equity. To be able to tap into their wisdom and experience, and then help us maximize the potential of these partnerships toward a common goal, is tremendously exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the most critical issue in education that needs to be addressed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;There are so many important issues that need to be addressed, but I think one of the most critical is ensuring that we instill in young people a hunger for learning at an early age and continue to stoke that fire with challenging, engaging content taught effectively, all the while holding ourselves and our students to high standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;One discouraging experience can extinguish a student’s academic confidence in an instant. We need to be mindful of that. But conversely, in an instant, a positive experience, reinforced and nurtured over time, can lead that student to realize that he is capable of more than he imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;Many years ago, when I was a graduate student writing my dissertation, I decided that I needed to do something to break up the monotony of sitting behind a computer all day, every day. I needed to do something that had a practical application that would remind me why I decided to embark on this journey to an English literature Ph.D. in the first place. So I signed up to teach middle school language arts in an after-school program in East Palo Alto, California, just down the road from Stanford University, where I was a student, but in many ways half a world away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;Unlike Palo Alto, East Palo Alto was quite economically depressed, and the students I taught — all students of color — came from families with limited financial resources. One day I decided to teach a chapter from Zora Neale Hurston’s autobiography &lt;em&gt;Dust Tracks on a Road,&lt;/em&gt; the chapter in which Hurston talks about her experience going to college as a young African American woman in the early 1900s. At one point I said to the class, matter-of-factly, “So, when you go to college….” I remember so many of the students looking at me as if I had said “Mars” instead of “college.” Many of them laughed. One student asked me, “What’s college?” And when she asked me that question, I knew in that moment how different the trajectory of her life was going to be from mine unless she not only understood what college was but knew that she could aspire to it. Perhaps that experience more than any other inspired me to make my life’s work education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can the College Board and its membership best address this issue?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;By reaching out and finding that student I just mentioned, making her aware that college is within her reach, giving her the tools to prepare for college, encouraging her to strive for higher learning and ensuring that challenging content is there to meet her, and then making colleges aware that she is prepared to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a former English lit professor, what was your favorite book to teach and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;One of my favorite books to teach was W. E. B. Du Bois’s &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Souls of Black Folk.&lt;/em&gt; I found it interesting to teach because it’s a text that is simultaneously and profoundly literary, lyrical, historical, and political. As a result, there are so many different points of engagement for the reader. I loved seeing students grapple with the challenging subjects such as race, class, and culture through these various lenses — and seeing which they chose as their point of entry into the text. I always found the student papers written about &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Souls of Black Folk&lt;/em&gt; among the most interesting, original, and enjoyable to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under your leadership, Ed Trust was recognized as a Great Place to Work by &lt;em&gt;Washingtonian&lt;/em&gt; magazine. What’s your secret?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;Oh gosh, no secret really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;But one of the first things I did when I got to the Ed Trust is go on a listening tour. I spoke with every single person in the organization and asked two questions: What do you think works well in the organization and what would you like to see us do better? I then analyzed the data and proposed to my colleagues a strategy for maintaining our strengths and prioritizing our areas in need of improvement. With organizational buy-in on the strategy, we then built the operational infrastructure to help us reach those goals and hired some wonderfully smart, talented, hardworking people along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;In addition to ensuring that we were operationally sound, we worked hard to ensure that our work — programmatically and operationally — was appropriately integrated, from long-term strategic planning to day-to-day decision making. But I want to stress that we worked on it. It didn’t happen overnight, and we never achieved perfection. But I can say with confidence that with each passing year we got better. The Great Place to Work recognition was special because it was our staff telling us they felt we were a great place to work. So it helped us know we were moving in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We know you like to travel; tell us about your most recent trip. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;My most recent trip was a five-day cycling adventure in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in North and South Carolina. We did about 40 to 45 miles each day with pretty steep elevation gain, most of the time in 95-degree heat. It was fun, and the scenery was beautiful. I enjoy a physical challenge, but typically I choose my climate more wisely. Lesson learned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Getting to Know Ericka Miller, College Board&amp;#039;s new Chief of Membership, Governance, and Higher Education&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
