The trip, which ends this week, is being filmed for a one-hour documentary that will air on PBS in spring 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “First-Gen Roadtrip” was a five-week adventure during which “Roadtrippers” conducted in-depth interviews with leaders who overcame obstacles and achieved college and career success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By speaking with leaders to learn how they got to where they are today, young students and job seekers alike are able to gain rare insight,” said Mike Marriner, cofounder of Roadtrip Nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vision for this project dovetails with the College Board’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/guidance/access-to-opportunity&quot;&gt;Access to Opportunity&lt;/a&gt; ™ (A2O&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;) program, which works to break down the barriers faced by low-income, first-generation, and underrepresented students and help them take advantage of the opportunities they have earned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Partnering with Roadtrip Nation on this unique and powerful project will give viewers a chance to hear directly from students about a topic that is relevant to so many others across the country,” said Steve Colón, vice president of Access to Opportunity.  “This work, combined with the College Board’s ongoing initiatives, can make a real difference in driving measurable outcomes for students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the Roadtrippers: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jasmine Johnson:&lt;/strong&gt; Jasmine is a sophomore at the University of South Carolina. Her family struggled to get by while she was growing up in North Carolina, and her tight-knit relationship with her family has sometimes prevented her from leaving her comfort zone. However, this has not stopped her from being the first in her family to pursue a college degree. “This road trip will allow me to take the first step outside my ‘Carolina bubble’ by giving me the nudge I know I need,” said Jasmine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenny Rogers:&lt;/strong&gt; Jenny is a first-year student at Mississippi State University (MSU). Since her mother passed away and her father was incarcerated, she has had to fend for herself and is putting herself through college. Although she is enjoying her time at MSU, she has struggled with gaining the confidence to decide on a major. ‘I hope that this trip will allow me to gain confidence in myself,’ Jenny said, ‘as well as meet people who struggled with and overcame the same lack of self-confidence that I feel.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Felipe Hernandez: &lt;/strong&gt;Felipe is a 24-year-old college graduate who plans to use his education to help low-income communities like the one he grew up in. He is a self-proclaimed natural-born leader who hopes to continue to travel and find adventure in his life. “I hope that this road trip will provide me with wisdom, guidance, and mentorship from leaders who have taken the journey I’m about to embark on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jonathan: &lt;/strong&gt;Jonathan is a sophomore at the University of Central Florida. Despite growing up in an impoverished single-parent household, he is pursuing his lifelong dream of getting a college degree. Although he fears failure at times, he hopes that this trip will expose him to others who have succeeded in the face of similar adversity. “I am really excited about the opportunity to speak with influential leaders who can help me become the leader I know I could be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advice from an Unexpected Place&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to their scheduled interviews, the road-trippers had the unexpected opportunity to talk with Alejandra Ceja, Executive Director of the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics, and U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Be authentic in what you do because once you do, people will listen and be more willing to follow,&quot; Ceja told the road-trippers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secretary Duncan sat down with the students inside the trademark Roadtrip Nation RV to share his advice on passion and success with the students: &quot;Try and figure out over time what you would do every day because you love to do it. Yes, you need to make a living, that&#039;s important. You need to pay the bills. But I&#039;ve done two things in my life. I played basketball for a couple years and the rest of my life I&#039;ve worked in education, and those are my two passions. There have been times when I&#039;ve made a lot of money and times when I&#039;ve made very little money and quite honestly it didn&#039;t matter to me because I&#039;ve always done what I loved. I feel so lucky to have done that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Roadtrip Nation and the College Board Team Up for First-Gen Road Trip&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

He discusses the district&#039;s new EMERGE program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What galvanized all our rethinking and changed policy into a new philosophy, though, was the creation of what we call the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.houstonisd.org/Page/112999&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 102, 153); font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13.1199998855591px; line-height: 24px;&quot;&gt;EMERGE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; program. It has shown how high expectations, backed by rigorous support, can turn low-income, high-potential students—those who, six years ago, probably wouldn&#039;t have been considered &quot;college material&quot;—into successes at some of the nation&#039;s most prestigious colleges and universities. These institutions are clamoring for bright, engaged young students who have had to work hard for their success, and they&#039;re willing to provide them with the support systems to succeed and the money to make a priceless education free or affordable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Going ‘All In’ for Our Nation’s Students of Color</title>
    <link>https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/academic/going-all-our-nation-s-students-color</link>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the last 10 years, the College Board’s Advanced Placement expansion efforts have nearly doubled the number of students who have been given access to the opportunities AP repeatedly proves to offer, including greater college preparedness and potential cost and time-savings through credit-granting policies. We are especially proud that low-income students have made up a significant part of that growth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we still have a long way to go. The PSAT/NMSQT® is currently the best indicator of a student’s potential to succeed in certain AP courses. But last year alone there were nearly 300,000 students with this potential who didn’t take an AP course for which they were qualified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap between earning the opportunity and seizing it is most pronounced among traditionally underserved minority populations. For example, only 3 out of 10 African-American students with high potential for success in AP science course work take an AP science course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One essential approach is to continue to bring AP into schools with these academically prepared and motivated students, particularly those with large minority and low-income student populations. To that end, we have developed partnerships with the Michael &amp;amp; Susan Dell Foundation to launch &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/initiatives/ap-opportunity-program&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(255, 120, 0);&quot;&gt;150 new AP courses &lt;/a&gt;reaching more than 9,000 low-income students in the next three years, and with Google and DonorsChoose.org to create 500 new &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/initiatives/ap-stem-access-program&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(255, 120, 0);&quot;&gt;AP STEM&lt;/a&gt; courses in public schools and enable more women and minorities to excel in science and math. The latter project enabled 10,000 students who did not previously have access to AP courses to take AP exams this past May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ironically, our greatest challenge may be to get more qualified students into AP classes in schools where AP already exists. A shocking two-thirds of students with AP potential who do not take AP classes attend schools that do in fact offer AP in their curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons are complex and manifold, but one thing is clear. According to public opinion research, the most powerful factor that turns a potential AP student into a registered AP student is the spirited encouragement and enthusiastic support of a teacher, counselor, or school administrator. In other words, adults who work in schools have enormous influence and can, by reaching out to a student with AP potential and encouraging her or him to take AP classes, quite literally change the education trajectory of that student. In schools with high percentages of underrepresented students, the cumulative impact can be incalculable. That’s why we started “&lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/k-12/all-in&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(255, 120, 0);&quot;&gt;All In&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All In is a College Board campaign that aims to unite educators, administrators, communities, and students themselves in an effort to ensure that every African-American, Latino, and Native American student with AP potential enrolls in at least one AP class and that every ounce of talent is given the chance to blossom instead of wither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In creating All In, we have been inspired by the hundreds of schools and districts that have already made enormous progress by supporting teacher professional development, removing financial barriers, aligning curriculum and instruction, and so much more. And we honor those that have made a concerted effort to identify and recruit students with AP potential, like last year’s Advanced Placement Large District of the Year winner, Texas’s North East Independent School District. Sheila Richards, one of its AP English teachers, describes the overall approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of our goals is to find students who might not otherwise participate in the program and to bring them in and assure them that we, the adults, are there to help them. We’re the support system and we’re going to use all the tools in the toolbox to make sure that they find success; (we tell the students) yes, it’s difficult, and, yes, you’ll be challenged, but we’re going to be there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invite you to be there for students as well by visiting our &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/k-12/all-in&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(255, 120, 0);&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, joining the All In campaign, and helping us get &lt;em&gt;every single qualified student&lt;/em&gt; into those AP classrooms. We want all in. No exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want all in because we believe that access to opportunity is as inalienable a right as the pursuit of happiness. And for a large portion of our nation’s youth, AP is what gives them a running start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s what led West Leyden High School Class of ’14 graduate Julius Figueroa to speak on a distinguished White House panel last week to discuss how AP paved the way for his acceptance to Columbia University this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s what inspired Derrick Simmons, who just graduated from Howard University, to go on to pursue a graduate teaching degree at American University while teaching math to low-income minority students in a Washington, D.C., high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s what has made—and continues to make—opportunity and success realities for countless thousands of students. But until these realities are in the vision and reach of every student—regardless of race, background, or family income—our satisfaction with what we have accomplished must be tempered by our obligation to do more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We share that obligation with the educators, counselors, and administrators at the literal doorsteps of our nation’s youth. We hope that, by joining All In, you will open those doors with the materials, knowledge, and strategies that will help every one of your students step confidently into the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Going ‘All In’ for Our Nation’s Students of Color&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The College Board is taking part in this new collaborative effort that will significantly enhance one of our major efforts: ensuring that all students and families have access to the best SAT and PSAT/NMSQT practice resources, completely free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Access sat down with Steven Colón, Vice President of Access to Opportunity, who attended the event in Durant High School in Durant, Oklahoma, to talk a little about this new initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is ConnectHome?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConnectHome is a new initiative with communities, the private sector, and federal government to expand high speed broadband to more families across the country, launching in twenty-seven cities and one tribal nation. Internet Service Providers, non-profits and the private sector will offer broadband access, technical training, digital literacy programs, and devices for residents in assisted housing units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the College Board’s involvement in this initiative?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanded broadband access will significantly enhance one of the College Board’s major efforts: ensuring that all students and families have access to the best SAT practice resources, completely free of charge -- and save students, families, and community-based organizations in these cities millions of dollars on commercial and private SAT prep costs. The College Board, in partnership with Khan Academy, will offer students and families in HUD housing in all ConnectHome communities free, online SAT practice resources, and contribute $200,000 over three years to fund digital literacy and personalized college readiness and planning training in Cleveland, Los Angeles, New York, San Antonio, Washington, DC and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will this improve student experience with technology and help to close the digital divide?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greater access to these resources, which are the finest and most authoritative in the world, will help level the playing field for students to prepare for both the SAT and college-level courses, particularly among lower-income students and reduce the digital divide, which disproportionately affects African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans so that all students can take full advantage of Official SAT Practice on KhanAcademy.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, through the use of personalized College Board accounts, students and families will be able to access rich college planning and search services, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;Big Future&lt;/a&gt;.  These tools empower students to take challenging coursework in high school, fully explore their college and career options, and apply to college.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Big Changes to College Application Fee-Waiver Program </title>

&lt;p&gt;Beginning this fall, more than 200,000 students who take the SAT or SAT Subject Test with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/register/fees/fee-waivers&quot;&gt;fee waiver&lt;/a&gt; will receive four college application fee waiver forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key process improvements include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aligning with higher education’s long-standing commitment to ensure that application fees are not a barrier.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Streamlining CAFW form distribution, which simplifies the process for students, counselors, and advisors by no longer requiring a second counselor validation.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relying on research that shows that giving CAFW forms directly to low-income students improves their college application and enrollment rates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Thanks to the collaboration with our higher education members who are committed to ensuring that college application fees are not a barrier to enrollment and success, college application fee waivers may be used to apply to any of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/pdf/college-application-fee-waiver-directory.pdf&quot;&gt;2,000 participating colleges and universities&lt;/a&gt;,” said Connie Betterton, the College Board’s Vice President of Higher Education Access, Research, and Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-generation students face particular challenges when it comes to applying to college, according to Donald Kamentz, Managing Director of College and Career Initiatives at YES Prep Public Schools in Houston, TX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Given their families’ lack of understanding and past experiences to reference in navigating the college application process, students often miss out on important resources that could help them navigate the application process and matriculate to college,” Kamentz said. “Not only will this change provide students with financial difficulties with an easier system of obtaining fee waivers, but it will also allow students to be more in control of their college application costs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes build on the College Board’s partnership with thousands of college professionals, high school counselors, and college advisors across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

This applies to entering freshmen at Illinois public institutions of higher education beginning in the fall of 2016.&lt;span&gt;A statewide AP college credit policy helps ensure that public universities and colleges consistently and fairly recognize AP students’ academic achievement and simultaneously provides these institutions with an innovative solution to improve retention and decrease time to degree.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;For Illinois students, families and educators, this means greater access to AP and all the opportunities that go along with it. With HB 3428 signed into law, Illinois now will have a statewide Advanced Placement credit policy ensuring that students receive the college credits they can earn as a result of their hard work in AP. At a time when AP participation and performance has increased significantly in the state, this law provides more students with a greater opportunity to graduate college on time. A bipartisan group of public officials in Illinois worked for this result, including Governor Rauner and the bill sponsors: Representatives Carol Sente and Mike Fortner and Senator Pat McGuire.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the Governors of Virginia and Texas signed into law similar legislation. With the Illinois bill signing, 17 states now award college credit state-wide or system-wide to students earning scores of 3 and higher on AP Exams. Efforts are underway in other states, including in Colorado, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Growing Momentum for AP Credit Policies in the States&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Many think of a new school year as simply a new start or a continuation of the same.  When we look at the hard work that occurs over the summer, we really see that there is a focus on strengthening our craft and sharpening our skills to be more effective in delivering opportunities to students both now and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The College Board Midwestern team has spent a great deal of time working alongside educators in the Midwest to review data, learn new and best practices to increase student achievement as well as plan activities designed to support educators as they work with students on a daily basis.  Currently there are 26 Counselor Workshops scheduled that will support over 950 counselors in their work.  These workshops are designed to provide school counselors with the information they need to help students prepare for college and career success. These workshops will provide updates on the SAT, the PSAT/NMSQT, and AP programs. Counselors will also receive an in-depth presentation on financial aid and tips from seasoned professionals in the field.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team is excited to see that each year more and more students in the Midwest continue to gain access to advanced level courses such as Advanced Placement. Our team has spent a lot of time working at the district level helping school leaders use effective tools, such as AP Potential, to find students who exhibit potential for more challenging coursework and strategically working to provide those students those opportunities they deserve.  This work is part of our Access to Opportunity Agenda.  We are very proud of this work and partnerships with school districts in the Midwest who are focused on increasing both access and student success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we reflect on the close of a summer and the start of another school year, we are excited about the emphasis and momentum for student success in the Midwestern states that has been built through the behind the scenes work of educators in preparation of turning student dreams into real realities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Getting the School Year Off to a Strong Start in the Midwest&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the frequency of its use to the high stakes attached to it, standardized testing is among the biggest hot-button topics in education today. The number of educators and families disputing its necessity has only risen over the years, with the last few years seeing a spike in the number of students opting out of participating in their states&#039; annual tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may come as some surprise that one of the first people who will admit that the current testing model is broken is also at the helm of the company that produces some of the biggest tests in K-12 and higher ed, the Advanced Placement and SAT exams. But according to College Board President and CEO David Coleman, &quot;Assessment without opportunity is dead. We don&#039;t need more tests. We need more opportunities.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Everything I&#039;ve seen convinces me that assessments alone don&#039;t solve problems,&quot; he told a packed theater at the New York Times Schools For Tomorrow Conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite admissions officers frequently citing the SAT&#039;s ability to help identify &quot;diamonds in the rough,&quot; data shows more than half of high-achieving low-income students taking the exam don&#039;t apply to highly selective schools. On the AP front, 14 states had no Hispanic or black exam-takers, and less than 20% women taking the AP Computer Science exam in 2010.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;We hoped assessment would level the playing field, but found that a test-prep industry arose that fostered the perception that testing merely recapitulates the inequalities tearing our society apart,&quot; Coleman said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For Coleman, it&#039;s not enough for College Board to say problems like inequities in course access, test-prep, and performance aren&#039;t their fault. &quot;It may not be our fault, but it is our problem.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, the company has detailed four rules for assessments that advance opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Assess only what students learn in the classroom and will use again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman illustrated this rule by asking the audience to consider SAT words, which might be defined as words a test-taker likely hadn&#039;t heard before and won&#039;t likely hear again. &quot;In fact, they&#039;re called SAT words because the only place you can reliably find them is on an SAT. But that&#039;s not OK.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, students shouldn&#039;t have to learn things simply because they&#039;re on a test, but because those things will have lasting value to their life and future success. For that reason, the SAT no longer has &quot;SAT words&quot; and instead features words (i.e. synthesis, analysis) that students will use numerous times throughout college coursework and career training. Additionally, the exam narrowed its math focus instead of trying to cover the topic in a manner that was &quot;a mile wide and an inch deep.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Ensure all students claim the opportunities they&#039;ve earned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixing the test was just the first step, Coleman said. When examining why low-income high-achievers didn&#039;t apply to highly selective colleges, College Board found that one major hindrance was application fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working with colleges, the company is now able to provide four fee waivers to all low-income students taking the SAT. In Advanced Placement, College Board has also launched an &quot;all-in&quot; campaign to improve the number of black and Latino students taking exams. In 2015, Coleman said, the number of states lacking black or Latino AP Computer Science exam takers was down to one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Assessments must earn students and families something worthwhile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students shouldn&#039;t be told to take a test &quot;because they have to,&quot; Coleman said. &quot;Students don&#039;t buy it, teachers don&#039;t buy it, and, increasingly, parents don&#039;t buy it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Advanced Placement, he said, students and teachers have an exact reason for why they&#039;re working hard: college credit. For that reason, the PSAT also now carries an additional $180 million in scholarship opportunities as part of College Board&#039;s partnerships with National Merit, the United Negro College Fund, the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, and the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Remember what assessments can&#039;t do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, Coleman told those gathered, is the most important rule because it hinges on the work students and teachers do every day. &quot;The only things that change performance are productive practice and great courses.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further assist in-class efforts, the College Board also partnered with Khan Academy to provide free test prep courses worldwide. The site launched this summer and has already been used by hundreds of thousands of unique users, who have solved over four million problems, according to Coleman. Additional partnerships with the Boys &amp;amp; Girls Clubs are meant to further ensure access to this material. For students who primarily only have Internet access via smartphone, the company is enabling them to take paper-and-pencil practice exams, which they can then snap a photo of and send over for grading and personal practice recommendations from Khan Academy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond making top-quality test prep free and equal, however, Coleman stresses the importance of daily work in class with teachers, using high-quality curriculum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&#039;s time to stop lecturing folks that assessments are worth it and to prove it,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;In the News: How the College Board changed its standardized testing approach&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>Breakout Recap: Understanding and Appealing to Low-Income and First-Generation Students</title>

&lt;p&gt;Coates and Thaden shared strategies for identifying the differences and commonalities within this growing segment of society;  information to support students in attaining postsecondary success; and best practices for how to tailor outreach to effectively appeal to these students and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In developing strategies and recommendations, Coates drew from her research on cultural and social capital, or the skills and knowledge “assets” that drive social and economic mobility. Coates said many educators incorrectly presume that low-income and first-generation students know how to do key things, like study for exams; locate and fill out financial aid forms; or get information on the college application process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not all first-generation or low-income students are the same, and they’re not all dealing with the same issues. We cannot label these students as low-achieving or expect that they have low expectations,” said Coates. “But many do feel like college is just not an option. They’re balancing the tension between what they’re learning in school and what they’re learning from their families or communities, which can create a lot of fear and stress about simply reaching out and asking questions. We need to encourage and build their confidence by promoting requisite skills – like reading, writing, and communication – so they can have the confidence to seek support.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coates encouraged educators to leverage the talents and successes of first-generation and low-income students, and the spirit and support of parents, to navigate the road to success and give them “a sense of how they can use their own gifts to accomplish their goals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thaden added that even if educators can get low-income and first-generation students excited to go to college, often the next big barrier is “how do I fund the darn thing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Knowledge about money just may not be there, and there is uncertainty about whether or not a college education is a good investment,” said Thaden. “It’s about getting these kids to understand that they are worthy of that investment, and getting someone to bet on themselves is a really big deal if they’re scared.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These kids encounter many competing priorities,” Coates said. “From family responsibilities and personal relationships, to lack of access to educational opportunity…these students are dealing with a lot. The message to students is constantly: you can do this,” said Coates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coates shared the work of Notre Dame’s Outreach and Engagement Recruitment efforts to identify and work with first-generation and low-income students in 7-9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade across the country, developing support systems and programming to help move these students forward. The mission of the university is embodied in this work: to help students reach their fullest potential, and to give back to the community in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thaden ended by encouraging institutions to consider or support guaranteed tuition programs; state mandated financial literacy in K-12; partnering with other higher education institutions, K-12 systems and community-based organization to support students; adding financial education components to the entire admission process, such as special orientation, college 101, or senior capstone courses; and student leadership training and peer programming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Breakout Recap: Understanding and Appealing to Low-Income and First-Generation Students&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What drew you to the College Board?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;I’m drawn to the College Board for a number of reasons. Initially I was drawn to the organization because I have tremendous respect for its influence, reach, and reputation for producing high-quality work. There are many organizations that promote opportunity, access, and success for students as they consider and pursue postsecondary education, but I can’t think of another organization that has the ability to engage so many actors in this effort — students, parents, teachers, counselors, secondary school administrators, college and university administrators and faculty, policymakers — all of whom are critically important when it comes to ensuring that all students acquire the knowledge and skills to succeed in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;I was also drawn to the mission of challenging all students to own their future, because it’s powerful and it rings true. I first encountered the College Board when I was a young person taking the PSAT/NMSQT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, and I remember how meaningful that experience was for me. I grew up with parents who expected me to go to college, but it wasn’t until I took the test that I truly began to own that decision. It wasn’t until that moment that I saw myself as a person preparing for college, and I became acutely aware that what I did from that point on to prepare myself for college mattered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What excites you most about your new role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;I’m excited that it brings together three very important functions — membership, governance, higher education — that are related but have the potential to be more integrated. There’s creative opportunity in that challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;I’m also looking forward to working closely with so many of our external partners — member organizations, Trustees, council members, postsecondary institutions — in our effort to achieve greater educational equity. To be able to tap into their wisdom and experience, and then help us maximize the potential of these partnerships toward a common goal, is tremendously exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the most critical issue in education that needs to be addressed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;There are so many important issues that need to be addressed, but I think one of the most critical is ensuring that we instill in young people a hunger for learning at an early age and continue to stoke that fire with challenging, engaging content taught effectively, all the while holding ourselves and our students to high standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;One discouraging experience can extinguish a student’s academic confidence in an instant. We need to be mindful of that. But conversely, in an instant, a positive experience, reinforced and nurtured over time, can lead that student to realize that he is capable of more than he imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;Many years ago, when I was a graduate student writing my dissertation, I decided that I needed to do something to break up the monotony of sitting behind a computer all day, every day. I needed to do something that had a practical application that would remind me why I decided to embark on this journey to an English literature Ph.D. in the first place. So I signed up to teach middle school language arts in an after-school program in East Palo Alto, California, just down the road from Stanford University, where I was a student, but in many ways half a world away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;Unlike Palo Alto, East Palo Alto was quite economically depressed, and the students I taught — all students of color — came from families with limited financial resources. One day I decided to teach a chapter from Zora Neale Hurston’s autobiography &lt;em&gt;Dust Tracks on a Road,&lt;/em&gt; the chapter in which Hurston talks about her experience going to college as a young African American woman in the early 1900s. At one point I said to the class, matter-of-factly, “So, when you go to college….” I remember so many of the students looking at me as if I had said “Mars” instead of “college.” Many of them laughed. One student asked me, “What’s college?” And when she asked me that question, I knew in that moment how different the trajectory of her life was going to be from mine unless she not only understood what college was but knew that she could aspire to it. Perhaps that experience more than any other inspired me to make my life’s work education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can the College Board and its membership best address this issue?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;By reaching out and finding that student I just mentioned, making her aware that college is within her reach, giving her the tools to prepare for college, encouraging her to strive for higher learning and ensuring that challenging content is there to meet her, and then making colleges aware that she is prepared to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a former English lit professor, what was your favorite book to teach and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;One of my favorite books to teach was W. E. B. Du Bois’s &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Souls of Black Folk.&lt;/em&gt; I found it interesting to teach because it’s a text that is simultaneously and profoundly literary, lyrical, historical, and political. As a result, there are so many different points of engagement for the reader. I loved seeing students grapple with the challenging subjects such as race, class, and culture through these various lenses — and seeing which they chose as their point of entry into the text. I always found the student papers written about &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Souls of Black Folk&lt;/em&gt; among the most interesting, original, and enjoyable to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under your leadership, Ed Trust was recognized as a Great Place to Work by &lt;em&gt;Washingtonian&lt;/em&gt; magazine. What’s your secret?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;Oh gosh, no secret really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;But one of the first things I did when I got to the Ed Trust is go on a listening tour. I spoke with every single person in the organization and asked two questions: What do you think works well in the organization and what would you like to see us do better? I then analyzed the data and proposed to my colleagues a strategy for maintaining our strengths and prioritizing our areas in need of improvement. With organizational buy-in on the strategy, we then built the operational infrastructure to help us reach those goals and hired some wonderfully smart, talented, hardworking people along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;In addition to ensuring that we were operationally sound, we worked hard to ensure that our work — programmatically and operationally — was appropriately integrated, from long-term strategic planning to day-to-day decision making. But I want to stress that we worked on it. It didn’t happen overnight, and we never achieved perfection. But I can say with confidence that with each passing year we got better. The Great Place to Work recognition was special because it was our staff telling us they felt we were a great place to work. So it helped us know we were moving in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We know you like to travel; tell us about your most recent trip. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;My most recent trip was a five-day cycling adventure in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in North and South Carolina. We did about 40 to 45 miles each day with pretty steep elevation gain, most of the time in 95-degree heat. It was fun, and the scenery was beautiful. I enjoy a physical challenge, but typically I choose my climate more wisely. Lesson learned!&lt;/p&gt;

Introduced by UC Associate Vice President of Undergraduate Admissions Stephen Handel, and College Board President David Coleman, who praised her unwavering commitment to propelling low-income and underserved students toward academic success, Napolitano shared what she called the basic truisms “that serve as important compass point” in guiding the work of higher education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first basic truism Napolitano shared:  &lt;strong&gt;you cannot cut your way to continued excellence&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This may seem obvious in the realm of higher education, however it is not,” she said. “In the last six years, 41 out of 50 states have asked higher education institutions to do this. It’s undeniable that the recession forced state legislators and governors to grapple with difficult decisions, but public funding is still strained even as the economy begins to recover.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite funding cuts in 20 states last year, institutions are expected to maintain their reputations and excellence, which presents an obvious challenge for higher education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Colleges and Universities bear a responsibility to streamline spending and eliminate waste, but waste is not synonymous with cost…and there are real costs to be born in higher education,” Napolitano said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next basic truism Napolitano shared:  &lt;strong&gt;the idea of the magic bullet is a myth&lt;/strong&gt;. “This is especially true when it comes to education and technology,” she said. She stressed that technology only serves as a tool to enhance what is already being done well, and public colleges and universities rarely have enough funding to implement necessary technologies with fidelity.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Napolitano added that to apply “smart public policy” recognizes the distinction between different kinds of institutions. This notion led to her third truism: &lt;strong&gt;one size dos not fit all&lt;/strong&gt;. “Not all higher education institutions are the same,” said Napolitano. “All possess different missions, serve somewhat different populations, and answer to different constituents. Implementing public policy is not only a multi-year process; it’s built carefully around nuance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final truism Napolitano shared: &lt;strong&gt;investment in education is an investment in an advanced, vigorous society&lt;/strong&gt;. “It’s no longer about brawn,” Napolitano said. “It’s about brains. It’s no longer about exploitation, it’s about innovation. It’s no longer enough to out produce or out harvest the world, we have to outthink it. The societies that will succeed are those that recognize how and why the world is changing and invest accordingly. When we talk about investment, we’re talking about investment in access and academic quality: equity, excellence, and rigor – the very principles of this forum.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Napolitano ended her remarks by sharing the motto of the University of California: Fiat Lux, which is Latin for “let there be light.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All of us who fight the education fight share the same mission,” she said. “Fiat Lux. I think shining the light of what higher education does and how it transforms society is a case we can take to the American public, and that’s the case that will help the next generation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Janet Napolitano Inspires Forum Attendees with Four Truisms of Higher Education&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

English language arts and mathematics teachers and school administrators chose SpringBoard as the core instructional program to support the magnet school’s goal of access and equity to college preparatory curriculum for all students. Some highlights of this implementation include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Due to the success of the program, student enrollment has increased from 500 to 640 students &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SpringBoard has been a major factor in raising student achievement for all demographic groups&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teacher collaboration has been a successful part of the implementation of SpringBoard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data from California’s Academic Performance Index (API) Reports indicate that Tetzlaff Middle School students gained more than 60 points since SpringBoard was introduced.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“SpringBoard has changed the way I look at classrooms. I now look at the level of student engagement, and I am amazed at the incredible growth among teachers as well as students,” said &lt;span&gt;Crechena Wise, Principal of Tetzlaff Middle School&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The purpose of this daylong event was to share information about the redesigned PSAT/NMSQT&lt;sup&gt;® &lt;/sup&gt;and SAT and begin discussions about how college access organizations can best use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;Khan Academy’s&lt;/a&gt; tools and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the top five things we learned during the summit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because the first administrations of the redesigned PSAT/NMSQT (October 2015) and SAT (spring 2016) are fast approaching, the college access community is eager to get the inside track on what to expect and to learn how to prepare their students for success; representatives from as far away as California, Minnesota, and Georgia traveled to New York for the Summit.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participants, including representatives from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bgca.org/&quot;&gt;Boys &amp;amp; Girls Clubs of America&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kipp.org/&quot;&gt;KIPP Public Charter Schools&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.collegehorizons.org/&quot;&gt;College Horizons&lt;/a&gt; (which provides college and graduate admission workshops to Native American students), and Pennsylvania’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.needld.org/&quot;&gt;NEED&lt;/a&gt; (a nonprofit offering college and career readiness programs for local youth), underscored the importance of ensuring that educators, parents, and students know exactly where to find the right tools, information, test practice resources, and support.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Members of the College Board’s Assessment Design &amp;amp; Development team led “Test Change 101,” a session focused on the redesign of the SAT and PSAT/NMSQT. One participant praised the team for “unfailingly [giving] real answers” during its Q&amp;amp;A session. Although there was an overall sentiment of excitement, questions remain about plans to support educators in curriculum preparations and to support parents in learning about Khan Academy’s free practice resources.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The College Board’s partnership with Khan Academy is of particular interest to the college access community; participants offered feedback on potential Khan Academy implementation models as well as possible challenges students may face, such as lack of Internet connectivity and mentor/volunteer training.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A closing session on the College Board’s Access to Opportunity&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; initiative inspired a dialogue among participants about sharing best practices to make sure schools, teachers, parents, and students are able to take full advantage of Khan Academy’s dynamic resources and tools.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leading up to the administration of the redesigned PSAT/NMSQT and SAT, the College Board will continue to develop resources and professional development opportunities designed to support college access organizations, with an emphasis on how to most effectively integrate Khan Academy’s tools into everyday work with students.&lt;/p&gt;
