That’s one of the first things he told the audience at his town hall discussion Wednesday afternoon at Forum 2015. He prefers to be honest, candid, forthright. And so, when he was asked about the subtle differences in administering the PSAT/NMSQT and the PSAT 8/9, he answered honestly: “I don’t have a command over the last-minute proctoring guidelines,” and he did not want to “dishonor” the importance of these technical questions by providing incomplete or incorrect information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, he gave out a College Board email address to which technical questions could be sent and ensured attendees that someone who did know the answers would get back to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exchange set the tone for the 75-minute discussion, in which Coleman reiterated the need for assessments to provide real opportunities for students and elaborated on the difference between “test prep” and “test practice”: “‘Catching up’ doesn’t happen in the few moments before the test,” he said, referring to last-minute cramming sessions. “The only things that really make a difference are great courses and productive practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One question from the audience about how the idea of “common standards” is misperceived by many spurred a particularly thoughtful response from Coleman: “I’m very discouraged about all of the fog around this. If you say ‘kids should have command of the founding documents and the great conversation they inspire’ — 98 percent of the population agrees.” The same, he said, held true when asking if people thought it was important for students to be able to read passages and answer questions based on evidence found in the reading. “Instead of saying ‘common standards,’ just say the specific skills,” and most people will agree. “That’s my best answer,” he said. “Get more specific.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;A Candid Discussion with David Coleman&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Read the original &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/collegeboard/2016/01/12/how-to-access-understand-and-use-psatnmsqt-scores/#2715e4857a0b3c821b6f5d71&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past October, more than four million students — a record number — took the PSAT/NMSQT (Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test) in schools across the country. Like the SAT, the test was recently redesigned to focus on the few things that matter most for college and career readiness, and to better reflect what students are learning in class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PSAT/NMSQT Score Reports are now available online, and we want to make sure that students and educators have what they need to take advantage of the valuable information and resources the reports provide. What follows is an overview on accessing, understanding, and using PSAT/NMSQT scores, along with helpful links that provide more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Access PSAT/NMSQT Scores&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students&lt;/strong&gt;: Students will need to create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://studentscores.collegeboard.org/home?affiliateId=aruhome&amp;amp;bannerId=pnscrs&quot;&gt;College Board account&lt;/a&gt; to access their scores. More information on &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/about/scores/score-report-help#troubleshoot-missing-scores&quot;&gt;accessing and understanding the new score report&lt;/a&gt; is available online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educators&lt;/strong&gt;: The College Board recently launched a new online portal for K–12 educators. It allows educators to view information for their whole school and track individual student progress over time. Throughout the fall, instructions for creating accounts were sent to PSAT/NMSQT administrators in schools and districts across the country. Educators can go online to find out more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/educators/k-12/accessing-scores&quot;&gt;accessing the portal&lt;/a&gt; and get answers to frequently asked questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding PSAT/NMSQT Scores&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzCSIilL3WQ&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;online score reports&lt;/a&gt; provide students with details on how they performed on the test and what skills they might want to focus on to prepare for the SAT, college, and beyond. Below are some things that students should look for when accessing their report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scores, Percentiles, and Benchmarks&lt;/strong&gt;: Students’ scores in Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and in Math indicate how well they are prepared for college-level work. Students can compare these scores to the college readiness benchmarks provided to find out whether they’re on track to be ready for college. Test scores, cross-test scores, and subscores give students a better understanding of which specific areas they need to work on. And, percentiles show students how their scores compare with the scores of students in the same grade across the country. Find out more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/educators/k-12/reporting-portal-help&quot;&gt;understanding percentiles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAT Score&lt;/strong&gt;: The PSAT/NMSQT and the new SAT cover the same sort of content, have the same question types, and are on the same score scale. That means students who took the PSAT/NMSQT in October have already seen the types of questions they’ll see on the new SAT, and their score on the PSAT/NMSQT is what they would’ve received on the SAT if they took the test that day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Score Ranges&lt;/strong&gt;: Projected score ranges show students what their scores would be if they took the SAT the following year. These scores are based on a research study of average growth and score gains for students in the same grade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test Questions&lt;/strong&gt;: Students will be able to see which questions they answered correctly or incorrectly, what the answers are, and which skills were being tested.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Merit Scholarship Program&lt;/strong&gt;: Students who took the PSAT/NMSQT are automatically screened for the National Merit Scholarship Program, an academic competition for recognition and college scholarships. Their report indicates whether they’ve qualified for entry into the program.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use PSAT/NMSQT Scores&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to details about test performance and areas for improvement, PSAT/NMSQT scores provide students with other information they can use. Students will find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which &lt;strong&gt;AP courses are good matches&lt;/strong&gt; for them. Taking these courses and exams lets students experience college-level work in high school and may earn them college credit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free, personalized SAT practice.&lt;/strong&gt; Students can sign up for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;Official SAT Practice&lt;/a&gt; and link their College Board and Khan Academy accounts to start preparing for the SAT based on their PSAT/NMSQT results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Details on college majors, scholarships, college application fee waivers, and career planning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out this &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/pdf/sample-psat-nmsqt-score-report.pdf&quot;&gt;sample online student report&lt;/a&gt; and find out more &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/about/scores/score-report-help&quot;&gt;details of the student score report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we continue to make regular updates to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;website,&lt;/a&gt; we encourage both students and educators to visit often for the latest information about the PSAT/NMSQT, SAT, and other College Board programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;How to Access, Understand, and Use PSAT/NMSQT Scores&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Over three years ago, the College Board embarked on the process of redesigning the SAT, PSAT/NMSQT, and PSAT 8/9. The new exams are focused on what research tells us students need to know to be ready for college and career, and they better reflect what students are learning in class. All three exams in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 56, 145);&quot;&gt;SAT Suite of Assessments&lt;/a&gt; are on the same score scale, so students and educators can easily track student progress toward readiness over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, PSAT/NMSQT results were sent to over four million students. The paper and online &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/psat-nmsqt-psat-10/scores/student-score-reports&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 56, 145);&quot;&gt;score reports&lt;/a&gt; include richer information than ever before, with new details about scores, percentiles, and college readiness benchmarks. To help make sure students and educators understand the significance of these new pieces of data, we’ve summarized what they mean, why we’ve included them, and how they should be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scores&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;Scores are the most important summary of a student’s knowledge, skills, and academic achievement. They communicate how ready students are for college and career, and they’re what colleges use in the admission process. PSAT/NMSQT scores, not percentiles, are used to determine a student’s National Merit Selection Index, and they provide the best indicator for how a student would perform on the SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Percentiles&lt;/strong&gt;: Percentiles are provided to help students understand their scores compared to how other students performed on the test. They show the percentage of students in a particular grade whose scores fall at or below a specific score. Educators and students can now see two types of percentiles on the score reports: user percentiles and national percentiles. Because October 2015 was the first administration of the redesigned PSAT/NMSQT, the percentile ranks reported for that administration are based on preliminary research. The user percentiles will be re-created using actual test-takers’ results in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User percentile &lt;/strong&gt;ranks have historically been based on students who took the PSAT/NMSQT in previous years. This year, preliminary user percentiles were based on a research study that includes students who took the old exam in 2014 and the new exam in 2015. The preliminary user percentile ranks will be replaced by actual user percentile ranks based on students who took the PSAT/NMSQT in 2015. These percentiles are most useful for students, parents, and educators in understanding how a student performed relative to other test-takers&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New this year, &lt;strong&gt;national percentile&lt;/strong&gt; ranks are also reported. These percentile ranks are based on a representative sample of all U.S. students. National percentile ranks allow educators to compare a student’s performance to the performance of a representative sample of all students in  the U.S., some of whom are planning to go to college and some of whom are not. Because of this, the national percentile ranks will look, on average, higher than students’ user percentile ranks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benchmarks:&lt;/strong&gt; Along with the redesign of our assessments, the college and career readiness benchmarks for each assessment — including the PSAT/NMSQT and the SAT —  have been redesigned to make it easier to track student progress over time, and to provide educators and students with more actionable feedback on academic strengths and weaknesses. These preliminary benchmarks are based on actual student success in entry-level college courses and will be revised as more student results become available. Specifically, the benchmark score for each exam in the SAT Suite of Assessments represents a 75 percent likelihood of a student achieving at least a C in a first-semester, credit-bearing college course in a related subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the new score reports, a  color-coded message underneath each section score tells students whether they’re on track to be ready for college-level work in that subject area. Green = on track; yellow = almost on track; red = skills need strengthening. And now, because scores from the SAT and PSAT-related assessments are on a common scale, students can follow their progress from one exam to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In redesigning our assessments, we worked with educators and drew from the most current research and evidence that show what students need to know in high school to be prepared for college. We also rigorously pretest each assessment to make sure it’s fair and valid for every student. This is part of our commitment to making assessments that are focused, reliable, and connected to information and tools that will help more students graduate from high school prepared for college and career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students and educators can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites#/sites/collegeboard/2015/09/30/why-taking-the-psatnmsqt-matters/#24195b1d7fed&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 56, 145);&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;find out more about the PSAT/NMSQT&lt;/a&gt; and read &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 56, 145);&quot;&gt;the latest information on the new assessments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newark, NJ&lt;/em&gt; – Newark Public Schools (NPS) today announced an expansive partnership with the College Board to further the district’s goal of increasing the number of students who graduate from high school and pursue a college education. Through this partnership, NPS will work with the College Board to provide expanded access to the Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT®) and the SAT®, as well as a higher quality and quantity of Advanced Placement® (AP®) course work, an important consideration in college applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our partnership with the College Board is critically important to the future long-term academic success of our young men and women. It is time that we offer students in Newark the same opportunities that students across New Jersey have been afforded for a number of years,” said NPS Superintendent Christopher D. Cerf. “The College Board is partnering with us to ensure that students recognize and make the most of the opportunities available to them and realize their tremendous potential.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;District leadership worked with school leaders and educators across the district to gather feedback on the decision and to identify the programs, resources, and assessments that would provide students with the most value. Our partnership with the College Board is designed to increase access to valuable assessments and courses that play a key role in the college admission and success process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT)&lt;/strong&gt;: Beginning this fall, NPS will provide the PSAT/NMSQT to all of the district’s 10th- and 11th-grade students. The PSAT/NMSQT measures the same skills and knowledge as the SAT, so students and educators will be able to monitor progress and identify areas in need of improvement. In addition, PSAT/NMSQT results are the best predictor of a student&#039;s likelihood to succeed in certain AP courses. And, students who take the PSAT/NMSQT can access more than $180 million in expanded scholarship opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAT School Day&lt;/strong&gt;: NPS will participate in SAT School Day in April, providing the test to all 11th-graders at individual schools across the district. SAT School Day helps foster a college-going culture and increases access to college, especially among first-generation college-bound students. SAT School Day is especially beneficial for those students who may otherwise face barriers to standard Saturday administrations and would miss out on this important step in the college-going process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Official SAT Practice Through Khan Academy&lt;/strong&gt;®: All students have access to free, personalized practice through Khan Academy, a leader in online education. Official SAT Practice on khanacademy.org is helping to level the playing field for all students who are interested in taking the SAT and preparing for college. Students who take the PSAT/NMSQT and SAT benefit from these tools, which help reinforce what students are learning in classrooms and focus on the content tested, not just test-taking strategies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The PSAT/NMSQT and SAT are assessments that provide opportunities for students to qualify for financial scholarships, as well as improve their college readiness,” said Superintendent Cerf. “We will stop administering unnecessary tests, and instead focus on providing assessments that offer valuable information to help advance our students’ educational opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NPS and the College Board will also work together to increase the quality and quantity of the Advanced Placement courses offered across the district. The district will begin by offering NPS teachers access to AP Mentoring, a teacher-to-teacher professional development program, to ensure educators are successful in leading AP course work. Research shows that students who succeed in challenging course work, such as Advanced Placement, are more likely to graduate college on time, and have the potential to save time and money through placement and credit-granting policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to partner with Newark Public Schools and the entire community of Newark,” said College Board President and CEO David Coleman. “Assessment without opportunity is a thing of the past. We are committed to partnering with the Newark Public Schools to ensure that every student has access to tests that can deliver powerful benefits, including scholarships, college admission, and course credit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board will expand its acclaimed Access to Opportunity™ program to more Newark students. The College Board will provide high school course work information, college application fee waivers, and critical financial aid guidance to Newark students. Additionally, the College Board will work with community-based organizations, such as the Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club, to train them on the use of Khan Academy practice tools so students can continue their academic preparation after the normal school day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Newark Public Schools Partners with the College Board to Expand Student Access to SAT Testing and AP Course Work&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Monday, Dec. 12, 2016&lt;/strong&gt;, students will be able to view their online score reports.  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When we released 2015 PSAT/NMSQT scores through a new online K–12 score reporting portal, many counselors told us the portal was difficult to use. We heard this feedback loud and clear, and our top priority is to improve counselors&#039; experience for score release in December.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here&#039;s what we&#039;re doing to help counselors and their students access, understand, and use PSAT/NMSQT scores:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Counselors told us that finding key information in the portal was challenging. So we&#039;re making it easier to use by rolling out enhancements, such as a new landing page with one-click access to the reports you use the most.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Counselors told us you wanted more time with PSAT/NMSQT scores before your students had access. Beginning Dec. 5, you&#039;ll have a full week with your students&#039; scores before they start logging in to the student portal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Counselors asked for more support and better resources to navigate the portal. So the week of Dec. 5 will be &lt;strong&gt;Score Week for Counselors&lt;/strong&gt;. During this period of educator-only access to PSAT/NMSQT scores, we&#039;re offering targeted online training, improved guidance, digital and print resources, and more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://cb.collegeboard.org/psat-nmsqt/score-week-for-counselors/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;psat.org/scoreweek&lt;/a&gt; and watch your inbox for details. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Save the Date: Score Week for Counselors, Dec. 5-10&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

More than 5,500 counselors participated in Score Week, taking advantage of 19 rotating webinars, video tutorials, one pager downloads, and enhanced customer service support for counselors who received their students PSAT/NMSQT scores a week before their students had access on Dec. 12.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn’t get to join the fun? Don’t worry! Video tutorials, one-pagers, and recordings of the webinars are still available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://cb.collegeboard.org/psat-nmsqt/score-week-for-counselors/&quot;&gt;psat.org/scoreweek&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Counselors said about Score Week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep Score Week for Counselors as a part of your service.  SO-O-O-O much better than the way scores were dumped on us last year.  I appreciate the improvements to the score portal!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you for including those of us independent counselors who work outside of a school. I know I will hear from my students next week looking for individual help interpreting PSAT scores and this information helps me do my job better! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;I learned so much more about how to explain PSAT scores to my students. I really appreciate these reports, powerpoints, and videos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you for supporting us via this webinar.   By giving us resources we can access for further review will enable me to understand and work at my own pace.  Thank you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The online portal is really clear now, and I feel very confident I can find scores, reports, and analysis.  This is really a tremendous offering to schools.  Thank you!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more resources related to PSAT-related assessments at &lt;a href=&quot;https://cb.collegeboard.org/psat-nmsqt/score-week-for-counselors/&quot;&gt;psat.org/scoreweek&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s just one of the ways the new SAT is leveling the playing field and making it easier for students to show their best work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, more than four million students received their scores from the October 2016 PSAT/NMSQT. Every one of those students now has access to a free, customized SAT practice plan on &lt;a href=&quot;file://nyodska01/aelwell/Link%20Day/satpractice.org&quot;&gt;Official SAT Practice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 18, students can help even more of their peers get ready for the SAT, simply by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIkCoQoZ21U&quot;&gt;connecting their College Board and Khan Academy accounts and sending their 2016 PSAT/NMSQT results to Khan Academy&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll donate laptops to libraries in the district* with the highest percentage of 2016 PSAT/NMSQT test takers who connect their accounts between &lt;strong&gt;October 1, 2016, and January 18, 2017&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; in the three districts* with the highest percentage who connect accounts any time on &lt;strong&gt;January 18&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help us spread the word! Tell your friends and family about this effort to make sure all students have access to the tools they need to get ready for the SAT. You can use the following language to share the news on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jan. 18 is our #SATPractice Challenge. Link your College Board and Khan Academy Accounts and get ready for the SAT. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.satpractice.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;www.satpractice.org&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Please note that in order for a district to qualify, it must have had at least 400 students who took the October 2016 PSAT/NMSQT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Get a Personalized SAT Practice Plan and Give Back to Your Library&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;On May 8, 2017, the College Board and Khan Academy announced promising new findings, based on data from the first full year of the new SAT&lt;strong&gt;®&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was time to shatter once and for all the bad idea that the SAT was an aptitude test, that the SAT measures something that’s unclear and hard to change. The new SAT makes it easier than ever for students to show their best work,” said College Board president and CEO David Coleman. “Students who devote themselves to free, personalized SAT practice on Khan Academy are achieving substantial score gains on the new SAT and claiming their futures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Studying for the SAT on Official SAT Practice for 20 hours is associated with an average score gain of 115 points&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s nearly double the average score gain achieved by students who don&#039;t use Khan Academy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the nearly 250,000 test takers studied, &lt;strong&gt;more than 16,000 gained 200 points or more between the PSAT/NMSQT® and SAT&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the 115-point average score increase associated with 20 hours of practice, shorter practice periods also correlate with meaningful score gains. For example, &lt;strong&gt;6–8 hours of practice on Official SAT Practice is associated with an average 90-point increase&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board waited for a full year of data to analyze before releasing these results. Researchers confirmed that practice advanced students regardless of their gender, race, income, and high school GPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we’re so excited about is every young person in America getting the chance to learn a powerful lesson: that through devoted practice you can advance yourself,” said Coleman. “These tests can never tell you who you are, and they never should have. They are only an invitation to what you might become through practice. We’re trying to do everything in our power to make the SAT a launching pad from which students can change their future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/opinion/owning-your-own-future.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; op-ed columnist Thomas L. Friedman celebrated the news, dubbing Official SAT Practice a proven tool for promoting lifelong learning and “owning your own future.” He wrote: “If you want to be a lifelong employee anywhere today, you have to be a lifelong learner. And that means: More is now on you. And that means self-motivation to learn and keep learning becomes the most important life skill...Some are up for that, some not; and many want to but don’t know how, which is why the College Board has reshaped the PSAT and SAT exams to encourage lifelong learning...The good news is that systems—like Khan-College Board—are emerging everywhere to enable anyone to accelerate learning for the age of acceleration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/average-score-gains-on-redesigned-sat&quot;&gt;Read the full press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRACTICE TAKES OFF.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its launch in June 2015, more than 3.7 million students have used Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy. Nearly 40 percent of all test takers reported using Official SAT Practice, making it the number one tool for SAT preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The SAT is a strong measure of college readiness. It is heartening to see this positive association between personalized practice on Khan Academy and growth in college readiness,” said Khan Academy founder and CEO Sal Khan. “This was only possible because of the hard work of many people, especially incredible teachers, counselors and school districts who have leveraged these practice tools for their students.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GET READY FOR TEST DAY.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind every story of student success is a teacher, counselor, advisor, coach, parent, or other caring adult.&lt;/p&gt;

We’ve put together a teacher/coach implementation guide, handouts for students and parents, video resources, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What drew you to the College Board?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;I’m drawn to the College Board for a number of reasons. Initially I was drawn to the organization because I have tremendous respect for its influence, reach, and reputation for producing high-quality work. There are many organizations that promote opportunity, access, and success for students as they consider and pursue postsecondary education, but I can’t think of another organization that has the ability to engage so many actors in this effort — students, parents, teachers, counselors, secondary school administrators, college and university administrators and faculty, policymakers — all of whom are critically important when it comes to ensuring that all students acquire the knowledge and skills to succeed in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;I was also drawn to the mission of challenging all students to own their future, because it’s powerful and it rings true. I first encountered the College Board when I was a young person taking the PSAT/NMSQT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, and I remember how meaningful that experience was for me. I grew up with parents who expected me to go to college, but it wasn’t until I took the test that I truly began to own that decision. It wasn’t until that moment that I saw myself as a person preparing for college, and I became acutely aware that what I did from that point on to prepare myself for college mattered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What excites you most about your new role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;I’m excited that it brings together three very important functions — membership, governance, higher education — that are related but have the potential to be more integrated. There’s creative opportunity in that challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;I’m also looking forward to working closely with so many of our external partners — member organizations, Trustees, council members, postsecondary institutions — in our effort to achieve greater educational equity. To be able to tap into their wisdom and experience, and then help us maximize the potential of these partnerships toward a common goal, is tremendously exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the most critical issue in education that needs to be addressed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;There are so many important issues that need to be addressed, but I think one of the most critical is ensuring that we instill in young people a hunger for learning at an early age and continue to stoke that fire with challenging, engaging content taught effectively, all the while holding ourselves and our students to high standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;One discouraging experience can extinguish a student’s academic confidence in an instant. We need to be mindful of that. But conversely, in an instant, a positive experience, reinforced and nurtured over time, can lead that student to realize that he is capable of more than he imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;Many years ago, when I was a graduate student writing my dissertation, I decided that I needed to do something to break up the monotony of sitting behind a computer all day, every day. I needed to do something that had a practical application that would remind me why I decided to embark on this journey to an English literature Ph.D. in the first place. So I signed up to teach middle school language arts in an after-school program in East Palo Alto, California, just down the road from Stanford University, where I was a student, but in many ways half a world away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;Unlike Palo Alto, East Palo Alto was quite economically depressed, and the students I taught — all students of color — came from families with limited financial resources. One day I decided to teach a chapter from Zora Neale Hurston’s autobiography &lt;em&gt;Dust Tracks on a Road,&lt;/em&gt; the chapter in which Hurston talks about her experience going to college as a young African American woman in the early 1900s. At one point I said to the class, matter-of-factly, “So, when you go to college….” I remember so many of the students looking at me as if I had said “Mars” instead of “college.” Many of them laughed. One student asked me, “What’s college?” And when she asked me that question, I knew in that moment how different the trajectory of her life was going to be from mine unless she not only understood what college was but knew that she could aspire to it. Perhaps that experience more than any other inspired me to make my life’s work education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can the College Board and its membership best address this issue?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;By reaching out and finding that student I just mentioned, making her aware that college is within her reach, giving her the tools to prepare for college, encouraging her to strive for higher learning and ensuring that challenging content is there to meet her, and then making colleges aware that she is prepared to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a former English lit professor, what was your favorite book to teach and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;One of my favorite books to teach was W. E. B. Du Bois’s &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Souls of Black Folk.&lt;/em&gt; I found it interesting to teach because it’s a text that is simultaneously and profoundly literary, lyrical, historical, and political. As a result, there are so many different points of engagement for the reader. I loved seeing students grapple with the challenging subjects such as race, class, and culture through these various lenses — and seeing which they chose as their point of entry into the text. I always found the student papers written about &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Souls of Black Folk&lt;/em&gt; among the most interesting, original, and enjoyable to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under your leadership, Ed Trust was recognized as a Great Place to Work by &lt;em&gt;Washingtonian&lt;/em&gt; magazine. What’s your secret?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;Oh gosh, no secret really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;But one of the first things I did when I got to the Ed Trust is go on a listening tour. I spoke with every single person in the organization and asked two questions: What do you think works well in the organization and what would you like to see us do better? I then analyzed the data and proposed to my colleagues a strategy for maintaining our strengths and prioritizing our areas in need of improvement. With organizational buy-in on the strategy, we then built the operational infrastructure to help us reach those goals and hired some wonderfully smart, talented, hardworking people along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;In addition to ensuring that we were operationally sound, we worked hard to ensure that our work — programmatically and operationally — was appropriately integrated, from long-term strategic planning to day-to-day decision making. But I want to stress that we worked on it. It didn’t happen overnight, and we never achieved perfection. But I can say with confidence that with each passing year we got better. The Great Place to Work recognition was special because it was our staff telling us they felt we were a great place to work. So it helped us know we were moving in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We know you like to travel; tell us about your most recent trip. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;My most recent trip was a five-day cycling adventure in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in North and South Carolina. We did about 40 to 45 miles each day with pretty steep elevation gain, most of the time in 95-degree heat. It was fun, and the scenery was beautiful. I enjoy a physical challenge, but typically I choose my climate more wisely. Lesson learned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Getting to Know Ericka Miller, College Board&amp;#039;s new Chief of Membership, Governance, and Higher Education&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;By taking the PSAT/NMSQT, students start exploring college opportunities and learn how their skills align with next steps in their journey to college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several of the key revisions for the PSAT/NMSQT include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;▸ Requiring students to demonstrate their command of evidence found in a wide range of sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;▸ Asking students to interpret the meaning of relevant words in context, while eliminating the need to memorize obscure words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;▸ Allowing students to focus in-depth on the math skills that matter most for college and career success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;▸ Improving students’ test-taking experience by removing the penalty for wrong answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The redesigned PSAT/NMSQT will be part of a system of assessments that provides information schools can use to monitor students’ progress toward college readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scoring for the redesigned PSAT/NMSQT will be on the same scale and have the same subscores, or Insight Scores, as the redesigned SAT, providing added benefits. All reporting information and supporting tools are being reimagined to help students connect to practice, leverage instructional resources, access scholarships, and ultimately succeed in college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current PSAT/NMSQT continues to serve students in the class of 2016 and younger. The College Board is preparing concordance tables so students and educators will be able to relate scores on the current PSAT/NMSQT to scores on the redesigned PSAT/NMSQT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PSAT/NMSQT will continue to provide essential student and educator resources such as AP Potential™, which identifies students who are likely to succeed in AP courses and on AP Exams, helping educators ensure students make the most of the opportunities they have earned. Test-takers also may choose to participate in Student Search Service&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, allowing colleges and universities to communicate with students. Students have exclusive access to My College QuickStart™, a Web-based resource offering personalized feedback on college readiness alongside college planning information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the PSAT/NMSQT will continue to help students in the 11th grade prepare for the SAT and enter the competition for scholarships from the National Merit Scholarship Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;UC’s Early Academic Outreach Program (EAOP) will work with the College Board’s Western Regional Office on its “All In” campaign, designed to eliminate academic barriers for low-income African American, Latino and American Indian high school students who show potential to enroll in advanced-level courses, such as Advanced Placement (AP) classes. These efforts include expanding the numbers of such students who take the PSAT/NMSQT, a standardized pre-college entrance exam.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“At the University of California, we want all qualified students to be aware of the academic experiences available to them and get an early start on planning and preparing for college,” said UC President Janet Napolitano. “That includes taking preliminary college entrance exams and enrolling in academically-challenging courses that can help prepare students for college and increase their chances for admission at UC.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the class of 2014, 49 percent of California students took the PSAT/NMSQT, and 35 percent of test-takers in California demonstrated potential for success in one or more AP classes. Yet, of those PSAT/NMSQT takers with AP potential, 31 percent did not take a matched AP course.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The “All In” campaign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; will bring awareness, training and advising to parents and high school students across California about the advantages of taking the PSAT/NMSQT and advanced-level high school courses, with the goal of increasing student participation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The College Board believes that all students should have access to the opportunities they have earned,” said Amy Wilkins, College Board senior fellow for social justice and director of the All In Campaign. “We are delighted that the University of California is also working on breaking down barriers for underrepresented minority students who show the potential to succeed in AP classes. We hope that other institutions of higher education will follow their lead.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The PSAT/NMSQT provides an early assessment of the reading, math and writing skills required for college. In addition to allowing students to practice test-taking strategies, the test helps students enter scholarship competitions like National Merit, provides opportunity for them to be recruited into AP courses offered locally, and connects students with important academic services like free online college and career exploration programs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The “All In” campaign will also provide educators with resources related to AP courses, including a list of students at their schools who demonstrated potential to perform well in advanced-level classes. With these resources, UC staff will work directly with school districts in Fresno, the Inland Empire, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Oakland, Sacramento, San Diego and San Francisco.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last spring, UC President Janet Napolitano reached out to thousands of low-income California high school students who were among the state’s top performers on the PSAT/NMSQT, encouraging them to pursue higher education at the university and take academically-challenging courses that could increase their chances of UC admission. The letter was part of UC’s partnership with the College Board, and targeted students whose PSAT/NMSQT scores demonstrated their ability to do advanced academic work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the letter, Napolitano also told students about the university’s Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan, which covers system-wide tuition and fees for California resident students who qualify for financial aid, and whose total family incomes are less than $80,000 a year. More than half of UC students who are California residents pay no tuition and fees thanks to the Blue and Gold program and other financial aid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Colloquium Recap: Assessment Team Presents an Update on Redesigning the SAT to a Packed House</title>

The panelists kicked off the Forum Colloquium with a review of the SAT College and Career Readiness Benchmark results: 42.6% of SAT takers in the class of 2014 met it. This percentage represents those students who are likely to be ready to take college-entry, credit-bearing courses and not need remediation and has remained virtually unchanged over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The redesign effort hopes to change these results by connecting the SAT suite of assessments more closely to what is happening in the classroom. “We will be connecting assessment to instruction. So teachers will see the questions and say ‘You bet. That’s what I’m teaching in my classroom.’” explained Cyndie Schmeiser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team then unveiled the suite of assessments and discussed the flexibility schools will have to implement them with fall and spring administrations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PSAT 8/9 (rollout fall 2015)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PSAT 10 (rollout spring 2016)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PSAT/NMSQT (rollout fall 2015)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SAT (rollout spring 2016)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these assessments will focus exclusively on what matters most for college and career readiness as appropriate at each grade level. This represents what is already happening in challenging classrooms. &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org&quot;&gt;The key changes&lt;/a&gt; and examples of old and new exam questions were shared as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Buckley, SVP of Research, took the stage to dive into the multiple ways his team is ensuring that the redesigned SAT is just as predictive, or more so, of college success than the current version. Specifically he described the importance of creating concordance tables to link one test to the other to compare scores, and the challenges associated with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme of connecting assessment to instruction came up again when discussing content validity studies and the national curriculum survey that was conducted to examine to what extent the key knowledge and skills needed for first year college success are being taught in high schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting elements Jack covered was the proposed vertical scale for the system to align the scores. For example, while the score range for the PSAT 8/9 may be 120-720 and the range for the SAT is 200-800, the results for both can be compared directly. “We will do a lot of work on the backend to make sure results are simple to use, simple to understand.” explained Jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session wrapped up with an exciting high-level overview of how students’ results from the PSAT/NMSQT can be used in conjunction with Khan Academy modules and practice exams to build Personalized Learning Roadmaps to support students throughout the preparation process.       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Colloquium Recap: Assessment Team Presents an Update on Redesigning the SAT to a Packed House&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The American Indian Graduate Center and American Indian Graduate Center Scholars (AIGC and AIGCS), Asian &amp;amp; Pacific Islander American Scholarship Fund (APIASF), Hispanic Scholarship Fund (HSF), Jack Kent Cooke Foundation (JKCF), and the United Negro College&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fund (UNCF) will use information from the PSAT/NMSQT&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to expand access to nearly $180 million in existing scholarship dollars to low-income and minority students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PSAT/NMSQT information will allow AIGC and AIGCS, APIASF, HSF, the JKCF, and UNCF to reach a better representation of high school students across the country who may not have otherwise been aware they were eligible for scholarship opportunities. Outreach will begin with students from the class of 2015 who have taken the PSAT/NMSQT during high school and opted in to receive materials from scholarship providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PSAT/NMSQT is the nation’s largest and most representative precollege assessment. In October 2014, a record 3.8 million students took the exam. As a result of the College Board’s ongoing efforts to expand access to the PSAT/NMSQT to a broader group of students, 77 percent (897,567) of minority students who graduated from public high schools in 2014 took the PSAT/NMSQT at least once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement reinforces the College Board’s commitment to making assessments a platform for delivering opportunity. These new partnerships, combined with the College Board’s long-standing partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalmerit.org/&quot;&gt;National Merit Scholarship Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (NMSC), create a portfolio of opportunities that reach every major segment of students. The scholarships will now range from programs focused purely on academic merit, to those available to students who meet specific financial, racial, ethnic, and other eligibility requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What this country needs is not more tests but more opportunities,” said David Coleman, president and CEO of the College Board. “The 3.8 million students who already take the PSAT/NMSQT will now gain access to nearly $180 million more in scholarships, early enough in their high school careers to change their futures. These partnerships complement our work with National Merit Scholarship Corporation, and further remove barriers to college and career success for students across the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the College Board launched a redesign of the PSAT/NMSQT. Like the redesigned SAT, the redesigned PSAT/NMSQT will be focused on the skills and knowledge evidence shows is necessary for success in college and career. The first administration of the exam will take place in October 2015.  In addition to scholarship opportunities, additional benefits of the current and redesigned PSAT/NMSQT include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Practice for the SAT;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A mid-high school check on whether a student is on target for college and career readiness;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detailed performance feedback and suggestions for how students can improve their readiness for college and career, including free, personalized SAT practice through Khan Academy;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Access to challenging course work by identifying students’ potential to succeed in Advanced Placement courses; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Access to free college and career planning resources such as Student Search Service®, My College QuickStart™, and BigFuture™.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Statements from the New Partners&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P. “Sam” Deloria, Director, AIGC&lt;/strong&gt;: “Since our founding, AIGC and AIGCS have been driven by a commitment to expand the number of American Indians  who earn professional degrees. We recognize how critical financial support is to ensuring students can pursue postsecondary opportunities, and working with the College Board allows us to reach a broader group of American Indian students who can take advantage of the scholarships we offer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neil Horikoshi, President and Executive Director, APIASF&lt;/strong&gt;: “Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) students are often left out of the conversation when it comes to intervention for college access and success. We are thankful for partners like the College Board, who recognize the need and are helping us inform AAPI students about resources they have to pursue a college education.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fidel A. Vargas, President and CEO, HSF&lt;/strong&gt;: “Our goal is to provide students all the tools they need to apply to college, do well in their course work, graduate, enter a profession, excel, help lead our nation going forward, and mentor the generations to come. Working with the College Board is yet another way we will be able to further our goals and help Latino students make successful transitions to college.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harold O. Levy, Executive Director, JKCF: &lt;/strong&gt;“The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation awards annual scholarships of up to $40,000 to high-performing students with financial need. By partnering with the College Board, we are able to engage a broader universe of high-achieving, low-income students that have the ability to excel when given the resources to develop their talents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael L. Lomax, President and CEO, UNCF&lt;/strong&gt;: “For 70 years, UNCF has worked to help students get to and through college. Partnering with the College Board will allow us to further expand our reach to African American students across the country who will benefit from being able to access the scholarships and resources we are prepared to provide.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PSAT/NMSQT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, SAT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, and AP&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Exams always have been opportunity assessments, linking students to scholarships, college admission, and course credit. Anchored in the belief that students today need more opportunities — not more tests — the College Board has redesigned these exams and connected them to a wider array of educational and scholarship benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students taking the PSAT/NMSQT will have increased access to money for college through the College Board’s partnership with five of the country’s leading scholarship providers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students taking the redesigned SAT can benefit from free, personalized, interactive practice tools on KhanAcademy.org.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The AP Program has partnered with college professors and AP teachers nationwide to create new AP courses in critical STEM fields, while partnering with states to enact uniform credit policies that will help ensure that students receive the college credits they have earned through AP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PSAT/NMSQT, SAT, and AP results provide valuable information that can help ensure that more students graduate from high school ready for college and career. To support&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;decision-makers in using these results to effect change for students, the College Board has outlined three strategies to improve access and performance, bolster college graduation rates, and further increase participation in STEM course work. These strategies are part of the College Board’s ongoing commitment to connect assessments with opportunities that help more students make successful transitions to college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need fewer tests that do more,” said College Board President David Coleman. “We’re seeing great momentum through the wide and growing range of opportunities that our assessments provide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are highlights from the &lt;em&gt;2015 Program Results&lt;/em&gt; and the recommended strategies to support educators and students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Access and Participation &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding access to actionable assessments and challenging course work is an important way to connect students to college and career opportunities. Significant gains were made in access to the three College Board programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PSAT/NMSQT: Record number of test-takers. &lt;/strong&gt;In the fall of 2014, a record 3.8 million students took the PSAT/NMSQT, up from 3.7 million in 2013 and 3.6 million in 2010.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAT: Growing participation.&lt;/strong&gt; A record 1.7 million students from the class of 2015 took the SAT, compared to 1.67 million students from the graduating class of 2014 and 1.65 million in the class of 2011. A total of 25.1 percent of SAT takers in the class of 2015 took the exam using a fee waiver, compared to 23.6 percent in the class of 2014 and 21.3 percent in the class of 2011.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AP: Record number of students takes AP Exams. &lt;/strong&gt;2.5 million students took an AP Exam in 2015, compared to 2.3 million in 2014 and just under 2 million in 2011.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Performance and Success&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased access to assessments can help educators monitor student progress, understand skill areas in need of improvement, and identify students’ potential to succee in challenging course work. Results from the PSAT/NMSQT are the best predictor of a student’s potential to succeed in certain AP courses. &lt;strong&gt;In 2014-15, about 520,000 10th-grade PSAT/NMSQT takers overall showed potential to succeed in at least one AP course.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AP courses offer students the opportunity to pursue college-level course work while still in high school. Students who succeed on AP Exams are more likely than other students to graduate from college on time, and they have the potential to save time and money through placement and credit-granting policies. &lt;strong&gt;More than 1.5 million students received a score of 3 or higher on an AP Exam in 2015, compared to 1.4 million in 2014 and 1.2 million in 2011.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assessment results also can inform whether students are on track for college and career readiness.&lt;strong&gt; Nearly 766,000 (48 percent) of 11th-grade PSAT/NMSQT takers met the grade-level benchmark, indicating they are on track for college and career readiness. &lt;/strong&gt;In addition, these results can help educators and policymakers see areas of progress and growth, as well as areas for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SAT is a proven and trusted indicator of college readiness and success for students from all backgrounds. &lt;strong&gt;More than 712,000 students (41.9 percent of SAT takers in the class of 2015) met the SAT College and Career Readiness Benchmark. &lt;/strong&gt;High school graduates who reach the benchmark are more likely to enroll in a four-year college and graduate on time than those who do not meet the benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Solutions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the results, the College Board has highlighted three ways in which education leaders and policymakers can help propel students toward college and career opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage more students to think about higher education and participate in the college-going process&lt;/strong&gt;. With the support of states and districts, &lt;strong&gt;SAT School Day&lt;/strong&gt; allows juniors and seniors to take the SAT in their schools on a regular school day and avoids common complications of Saturday testing — such as part-time jobs, family responsibilities, and finding transportation. To date, all states that have made this commitment to access have seen growth in the number of students meeting the benchmark and gaining access to college.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Said Chief of Assessment Cyndie Schmeiser: “We are excited that more students are participating in SAT School Day because of all the benefits that come with it. By removing common barriers for students — like transportation or weekend work commitments — we are able to foster a college-going culture and increase access to college, especially among first-generation college-bound students. Through our assessments, we’re connecting students to opportunity with college application fee waivers and free personalized practice with Khan Academy, thereby encouraging more students to pursue a college education.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help students make the most of their college experience and graduate in four years&lt;/strong&gt;. The AP Program enlists and encourages talented teachers, provides exciting,in-depth classroom experiences, and gives students the opportunity to master challenging subject matter that often is related to their choice of a college major. &lt;strong&gt;A statewide AP college credit policy &lt;/strong&gt;helps ensure that public universities and colleges consistently and fairly recognize AP students’ academic achievements and simultaneously provides these institutions with an innovative solution to improve retention and decrease time to degree. As of August 2015, 17 states — most recently Illinois, Texas, and Virginia — have implemented unified and consistent statewide or systemwide AP policies to ensure that students’ achievements are equitably recognized.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure that more students are inspired and prepared to become the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) professionals our nation needs. &lt;/strong&gt;According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the need for jobs in science, technology, engineering, and math is expected to increase by 13 percent between 2012 and 2022 (versus 11 percent growth for all occupations). As a nation, we are not graduating nearly enough STEM majors to meet this need. Research shows that students who take AP math and science courses are more likely than non-AP students to earn degrees in physical science, engineering, and life science disciplines. To address this need, &lt;strong&gt;the AP Program has expanded its STEM offerings&lt;/strong&gt;. In 2014-15, their inaugural year, AP Physics 1 and 2 showed the largest growth of any courses in the history of AP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Senior Vice President of AP and Instruction Trevor Packer said: “We believe that inspiring and preparing students for in-demand STEM careers is an important opportunity for AP math and science courses. The launch of the AP Physics 1 and 2 courses this year attracted nearly double the number of high school students to enroll in algebra-based AP Physics classes, and demand for AP Computer Science A and our forthcoming AP Computer Science Principles is high. These results show that America’s students are eager to take on the challenge of STEM.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;A Look Forward&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the College Board announced it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;redesign&lt;/a&gt; the SAT and PSAT/NMSQT and introduce the PSAT&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; 10 and PSAT 8/9&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; to focus on the skills that recent data show matter most for success in college and career. A parallel focus on depth over breadth has been informing the redesign of AP course frameworks and exams so that teachers and students gain more time to develop the knowledge and skills required in college course work. The redesigned courses and assessments will launch on a rolling basis. Redesigned courses and exams in &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/arts-and-world-languages/art-history&quot;&gt;AP Art History&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/english-history-and-social-science/european-history&quot;&gt;AP European History&lt;/a&gt;, along with a new course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/ap-capstone/ap-research&quot;&gt;AP Capstone&lt;sup&gt;™ &lt;/sup&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt;, are in place for the 2015-16 school year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first administrations of the PSAT/NMSQT and PSAT 8/9 will take place in October 2015, and the first administrations of the PSAT 10 and SAT will be given in March 2016. Working with College Board members and partners, the redesigned assessments will connect students to more opportunities than ever before, including fee waivers for assessments and college applications, increased access to more scholarships, and free, personalized practice tools on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;KhanAcademy.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;2015 College Board Program Results Show More Students Taking Challenging Courses, Need to Improve Readiness Remains&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Read the original &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/collegeboard/2015/09/30/why-taking-the-psatnmsqt-matters/&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, millions of students take the&lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/psat-nmsqt-psat-10&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 56, 145);&quot;&gt; PSAT/NMSQT&lt;/a&gt; — the Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test — but many students and parents are unaware of the benefits of this exam. As a former high school teacher, I witnessed firsthand how the PSAT/NMSQT is more than just a test you take at school: It opens the door to scholarships, information from colleges, AP classes, and free practice for the SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this year’s sophomores and juniors get ready to take the PSAT/NMSQT in October, here are five important things to know about the test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. It helps students prepare for the&lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 56, 145);&quot;&gt; new SAT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which, like the PSAT/NMSQT, was recently redesigned to measure the skills and knowledge that matter most for college and career success and to better reflect what students are learning in class. The PSAT/NMSQT is closely aligned, both in content and format, to the new SAT, which will be first administered in March 2016. This means that students will get excellent practice for the new SAT — an important part of the college admission process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Today’s students can take advantage of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 56, 145);&quot;&gt;free practice tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that were not available during my teaching days (though I wish they had been). The College Board and Khan Academy are now offering personalized, online practice for the new SAT at no cost to students. And because the SAT and PSAT/NMSQT are so closely aligned, these tools are useful for both tests. Once students get their PSAT/NMSQT scores, they’ll be able to link them to Khan Academy for additional personalized practice recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. It provides valuable information about students’ progress toward college readiness.&lt;/strong&gt; The PSAT/NMSQT is one in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/about&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 56, 145);&quot;&gt;series of assessments that measure the same skills and knowledge&lt;/a&gt; at different grade levels. These assessments are scored on a common scale, so it’s easy to see the progress students are making from year to year. And when teachers have a baseline measurement of academic strengths and weaknesses before students reach 12th grade, they are better equipped to provide the individual support students need to graduate ready to succeed in college and career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. It alerts students to their &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/about/benefits/connect-to-ap&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 56, 145);&quot;&gt;potential to succeed in college-level AP courses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; When students receive their PSAT/NMSQT results beginning in December, the score report will let them, their teachers, and their counselors know which specific AP courses are a good match for them. Research shows that all students who take AP Exams are more likely to graduate college on time in four years. And, students who score a 3 or higher on AP Exams can save time and money by earning college credit.&lt;/p&gt;
