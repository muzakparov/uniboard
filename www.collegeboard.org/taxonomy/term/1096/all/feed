&lt;p&gt;The College Board was one of seven organizations represented at a recent convening of leaders and advocates for the school counseling profession at San Diego State University, in partnership with the White House&#039;s College Opportunity Agenda and the First Lady’s Reach Higher Initiative. Participating organizations include the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.counseling.org/&quot;&gt;American Counseling Association&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schoolcounselor.org/&quot;&gt;American School Counselor Association&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cacrep.org/&quot;&gt;Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.collegeaccess.org/&quot;&gt;National College Access Network&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nacacnet.org/&quot;&gt;National Association for College Admission Counseling&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sreb.org&quot;&gt;Southern Region Education Board&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this convening, the College Board and participating organizations have released the following statement outlining the necessary components of effective college counseling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;&quot;The national organizations represented at the SDSU White House convening believe in the right of every student to have access to counseling and advisement for postsecondary (career and education) preparation, access and success. The organizations further acknowledge the diversity of professionals who serve students in this regard, including school counselors, advisors, and other professionals, each with different specialized training, skills and competencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;However, the national organizations agree that there are common prerequisites for the effective delivery of counseling and advisement for postsecondary preparation, access and success, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A commitment to collaboration among professionals in service to students;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cultural competence and the ability to work with &lt;u&gt;all &lt;/u&gt;students, including students who are currently underserved and underrepresented.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in the use of data to assist in identifying, designing, implementing, and evaluating policies and practices related to counseling and advising students for post-secondary access and success.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Training in both the theory and practice of advising students for postsecondary access and success.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;As a direct outcome of the White House convening, the national organizations in attendance agree to commit to the formation of a collaborative council, effective immediately, to achieve the following short-term goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conduct a comprehensive multi-organizational, multi-institutional asset map of competencies, knowledge/skillset requirements, and resources for advising students for postsecondary access and success.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify other concrete priorities for the council to address, including, but not limited to, advocacy, research and communication to policymakers and administrators on behalf of counseling and advising professionals.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College Board Kicks Off National School Counselor Week with Joint Statement on College Counseling&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

New developments such as the expanded scholarship opportunities through the PSAT/NMSQT®, the College Readiness and Success System and the Assessment Redesign, and our Access to Opportunity&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; initiatives provide the foundation for this work. There is one place at the College Board that has had its feet on the ground and has been working to deliver opportunity directly to students in the Washington, D.C., area for over 47 years: the Educational Opportunity Center (EOC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Educational Opportunity Center is one of a set of eight educational opportunity outreach programs federally funded by the U.S. Department of Education — collectively &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/trio/index.html&quot;&gt;called TRiO programs&lt;/a&gt; — that help low-income, first-generation students pursue educational opportunities. Originally founded in 1967 as an Educational Talent Search program by local college admission officials, financial aid representatives, and staff from the College Board’s Washington Office, the EOC is one of 120 such centers throughout the country focused on enhancing the college and career prospects of disadvantaged individuals by connecting them with academic and financial information that can help them reach their full potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the District of Columbia, a dedicated and experienced staff of six counselors serves over 3,000 first-generation potential college students, low-income adults, and displaced workers annually, providing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assistance with applications for admission and financial aid&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information on financial aid resources and scholarships available to pay for college or vocational training&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;College and career counseling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Financial and economic literacy workshops&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GED practice testing and registration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adult-learner and college survival skill workshops&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;EOC counselors take an active role in serving D.C. residents and spend considerable time reaching out to and working with students and adult learners who have expressed a desire for postsecondary education that can help them meet their personal and professional goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EOC is directly connected to the College Board’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/guidance/access-to-opportunity&quot;&gt;Access to Opportunity&lt;/a&gt; initiative, which seeks to identify and break down barriers that often keep students — particularly students from underserved backgrounds — from applying to and enrolling in college. From launching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/k-12/all-in&quot;&gt;All In campaign&lt;/a&gt; to encourage students of color who are likely to succeed in at least one AP course, to easing the financial burden of applying to college by providing college application fee waivers, the College Board is dedicated to connecting all students to college success and opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Access will continue to feature the work of the EOC and its alignment with the Access to Opportunity initiative in the coming months. Please contact Jerome Jackson by email at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:jjackson@collegeboard.org&quot;&gt;jjackson@collegeboard.org&lt;/a&gt; or by phone at 202-741-4730 for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

Read the original &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/collegeboard/2015/09/30/why-taking-the-psatnmsqt-matters/&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, millions of students take the&lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/psat-nmsqt-psat-10&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 56, 145);&quot;&gt; PSAT/NMSQT&lt;/a&gt; — the Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test — but many students and parents are unaware of the benefits of this exam. As a former high school teacher, I witnessed firsthand how the PSAT/NMSQT is more than just a test you take at school: It opens the door to scholarships, information from colleges, AP classes, and free practice for the SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this year’s sophomores and juniors get ready to take the PSAT/NMSQT in October, here are five important things to know about the test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. It helps students prepare for the&lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 56, 145);&quot;&gt; new SAT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which, like the PSAT/NMSQT, was recently redesigned to measure the skills and knowledge that matter most for college and career success and to better reflect what students are learning in class. The PSAT/NMSQT is closely aligned, both in content and format, to the new SAT, which will be first administered in March 2016. This means that students will get excellent practice for the new SAT — an important part of the college admission process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Today’s students can take advantage of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 56, 145);&quot;&gt;free practice tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that were not available during my teaching days (though I wish they had been). The College Board and Khan Academy are now offering personalized, online practice for the new SAT at no cost to students. And because the SAT and PSAT/NMSQT are so closely aligned, these tools are useful for both tests. Once students get their PSAT/NMSQT scores, they’ll be able to link them to Khan Academy for additional personalized practice recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. It provides valuable information about students’ progress toward college readiness.&lt;/strong&gt; The PSAT/NMSQT is one in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/about&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 56, 145);&quot;&gt;series of assessments that measure the same skills and knowledge&lt;/a&gt; at different grade levels. These assessments are scored on a common scale, so it’s easy to see the progress students are making from year to year. And when teachers have a baseline measurement of academic strengths and weaknesses before students reach 12th grade, they are better equipped to provide the individual support students need to graduate ready to succeed in college and career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. It alerts students to their &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/about/benefits/connect-to-ap&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 56, 145);&quot;&gt;potential to succeed in college-level AP courses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; When students receive their PSAT/NMSQT results beginning in December, the score report will let them, their teachers, and their counselors know which specific AP courses are a good match for them. Research shows that all students who take AP Exams are more likely to graduate college on time in four years. And, students who score a 3 or higher on AP Exams can save time and money by earning college credit.&lt;/p&gt;

These are the counselors who typically need the most resources and support, yet they do not receive the funds or time to pursue outside professional development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professional Pathways, which operates through the Illinois Association for College Admission Counseling (IACAC), gives counselors the data and research, professional development opportunities, time, and supportive partners they need to develop new strategies and approaches for preparing their students for postsecondary success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We spoke with Gilfillan, president of IACAC and counselor at Woodlands Academy, and Drew Eder, a counselor at Highland Park High School and member of the IACAC High School Professional Development Committee, to learn more about the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The interview below has been lightly edited and condensed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Access: What motivated you to create Professional Pathways? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beth Gilfillan&lt;/strong&gt;: District Directions, the program in San Diego after which Professional Pathways is modeled, is data-driven and responsive to the particular needs of each district it serves. Its volunteer faculty spends over a year with its counselors, gets to know them, assesses their strengths and opportunities for growth, and tailors programs to them. I was amazed at this level of commitment and the emphasis on data and concrete programming. Often, professional development opportunities for counselors teach us about issues or updates in the college counseling world, but they do not offer strategies for improving or measuring the effectiveness of interventions. District Directions and Professional Pathways measure what is working and what isn’t and train counselors so they feel empowered to make changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After attending the two-day District Directions retreat in San Diego, I was determined to make this happen in Illinois. Through the support of IACAC’s executive board and the High School Counselor Professional Development committee, we were able to start working with a school district in late summer of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: Why is it valuable for counselors to have programs like Professional Pathways?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BG:&lt;/strong&gt; The landscape for high school counselors, especially in the college realm, is constantly changing. From new policies on admission tests and applications to financial aid changes, we have to continuously educate ourselves so we can best serve our students. Rarely is this education offered within our schools; usually professional development is geared toward teachers. And even when counselors are allowed to pursue training outside their district, they often need to use personal time and/or funding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professional Pathways aims to partner with districts that have received little training in the past but have counselors who are eager to learn and work toward college access and attainment goals. In Waukegan, for example, the counselors rarely have time to collaborate and share best practices. During our retreat, they had time to brainstorm, collaborate, and plan together. They left with clear, data-driven goals and ways to measure success, which they have already implemented. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drew Eder:&lt;/strong&gt; I believe the most important qualities of Professional Pathways are that the work is data-driven and the professional development is concentrated on the specific needs of the counseling staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the retreat, the Professional Pathways staff spends a half day with district counselors to complete a thorough needs assessment. This helps us build relationships and allows the retreat to be catered toward the needs of each counselor. Breakout session topics and speakers are chosen based on feedback from the group instead of assumed needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus on local data from each school is also valuable. Having disaggregated data to guide and focus discussion is imperative, as is allowing time for counselors to concentrate on their craft as a team and set measurable goals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: What are the biggest changes you’ve seen in the district — for counselors and for students — since launching Professional Pathways? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BG: &lt;/strong&gt;I have already seen and heard an empowerment in the department that was not as strong prior to this program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the initial phase of the program, we paired each Waukegan counselor up with an experienced counselor to work as a Professional Pathways “partner.” Each partner acts as someone to bounce ideas off and share best practices and professional development resources with. Many of the partners communicate regularly and have said that having a partner outside their district has opened up new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: What excites you most about this work? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BG:&lt;/strong&gt; I am most excited to see counselors feel like they have a voice and can make positive changes — even small ones — that will have a direct impact on their students’ college outcomes. I enjoy seeing counselors start to feel comfortable with the college search and application processes and have the confidence to implement changes in their practice. Seeing the counselors come together, brainstorm, and problem-solve is amazing, especially because they did not have many opportunities to do this in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am also excited about the level of support and interest through IACAC and beyond. We have 25 experienced counselors volunteering as partners for each of the Waukegan counselors, six dedicated committee members who plan the program, and 29 volunteers from high schools, colleges, and nonprofit organizations who helped run the retreat. Everyone is eager to help train and support this district, its counselors, and the students they serve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DE:&lt;/strong&gt; The most exciting part of the work for me was watching the counselors come together to create their action plans during the retreat. While the overnight part of the program added an expense, I believe it was the true difference-maker. People enjoyed each other’s company, laughed over dinner, and the fun atmosphere carried over to the work the next day; you could see people working as a team and problem-solving together. The extra time allowed counselors to let go of the work at school and focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: What advice would you give counselors interested in starting an initiative like this in their own communities? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BG:&lt;/strong&gt; Try it!  One thing I’ve learned is, even small changes can make great impacts. Take advantage of existing community resources and collaborate with community efforts. It’s important to have buy-in from the administration, so make sure you know the community and district and have concrete examples of how your program can positively affect their college access and attainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, most importantly, have a dedicated, passionate team in place.  It makes everything easier and more worthwhile in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DE:&lt;/strong&gt; Find a small group of dedicated professionals who want to mentor a group of counselors, and go for it! The support from our ACAC executive board was tremendous, and its approval for two years of funding was instrumental. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also owe a great deal to the team of counselors in California who originally ran this program and allowed us to “steal” it. They were incredible mentors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, don’t be afraid to make the program your own. We used some parts of the California model, but others were not applicable to us. Make it your own and give it a shot. Even if there are some bumps in the road, the impact on counselors and students will be tremendous!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Supporting Counselors to Support Students: Professional Pathways in IL &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
