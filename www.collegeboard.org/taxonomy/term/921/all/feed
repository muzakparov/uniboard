Jeff Olson, who also presented for the Guidance and Admissions and Academic assemblies, gave financial aid professionals information about the College Board’s plan to improve the way the organization uses data, and the implications for financial aid in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Council chair Karen Cooper, director of financial aid at Stanford University, Chair-elect Jon McGee, Vice President for Planning and Public Affairs at College of St. Benedict and St. Johns University, and Past Chair Mary Nucciarone, director of financial aid at the University of Notre Dame sat down with All Access to discuss the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Access&lt;/strong&gt;: What are some takeaways from this meeting about the issues currently facing the financial aid community?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon McGee&lt;/strong&gt;: Right now, we’re all freaked out about “affordability” but none of us really know what that means. We need to use these meetings to talk about key issues in financial aid and affordability that have implications for the College Board, but also broad financial aid community. This meeting is a venue to convey the current work of the College Board to members, but also offers the opportunity for members to convey their important work to the College Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karen Cooper&lt;/strong&gt;: The assembly meetings allow us to think about where we want to take deeper dives during our upcoming National Council meetings. When we meet in December, one of the big things we will spend time talking about is how the College Board is reimagining PROFILE. Given the broad implications for financial aid in the next few years, reimagining PROFILE is an important project, and we encourage all members to be engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JM&lt;/strong&gt;: Because the Council meeting will be immediately post-election, we’ll also need to talk about the Higher Education Act reauthorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mary Nucciarone&lt;/strong&gt;: The information Jeff presented in particular offers an opportunity for us to learn about the financial aid pathways to our institutions, and better understand the experience of our students. The Khan Academy piece is a very important portal to expand access, especially because it would increase access to financial literacy resources. As financial aid professionals, one of our biggest responsibilities and challenges is to get people to understand college costs, and help them navigate the financial aid process successfully. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College Scholarship Service Assembly Meeting Addresses Pressing Issues in Financial Aid&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

He then announced a new board chair. &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2014/11/christiansen-college-board/&quot;&gt;Douglas L. Christiansen&lt;/a&gt;, vice provost for university enrollment affairs, dean of admissions and financial aid and associate professor of public policy and higher education and accepted his nomination as chair of the College Board’s Board of Trustees, and gave remarks about the exciting precipice on which the organization stands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “There is a feeling of excitement among attendees this year,” said Christiansen. “It’s palpable, and it is because the College Board is truly taking action to deliver opportunities to students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christiansen cited significant organization-wide initiatives that are driving this action, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;assessment redesign&lt;/a&gt; and the College Board’s partnership with Khan Academy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christiansen’s vision is in keeping with the College Board’s four key tenets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare &lt;/strong&gt;students for success through access to high-quality instruction and assessment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Propel &lt;/strong&gt;students toward college and career by working to simplify the college planning process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reach&lt;/strong&gt; higher by providing high-quality programs and services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thrive &lt;/strong&gt;as an organization by strengthening relationships, services, and communication to better serve the needs of students.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These core principles are the force behind the forward momentum within the College Board that will be the hallmark of Christiansen’s chairmanship. In addition to the assessment redesign and the exciting new partnerships and programs that are on the horizon, Christiansen stressed the importance of the College Board’s members and their support for these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Each of you is critical to the College Board’s mission,” said Christiansen as he addressed the membership. “Board members, community members, staff, and leadership must all work together as a team to further the mission and take the College Board to the next level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Vanderbilt’s chief enrollment strategist, Christiansen oversees several offices and programs. He is an expert on issues of enrollment management, domestic and international admissions, access and equity, and revenue generation funding models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christiansen’s College Board resumé is long and robust, making him extremely qualified to lead the Board of Trustees into the next phase of delivering opportunities to students. He has served on the Board of Trustees since 2011, and last year was chair of the Finance Committee, on which he served for three years. Prior to being a Trustee, Christiansen served on the College Board’s Task Force on Admissions in the 21st Century, the Advanced Placement&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; National Higher Education Advisory Council, the Trustee-appointed Membership Committee, and the National Colloquium Planning Committee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Douglas L.

Ericka will lead our overall work in Membership, Governance, and Higher Education, ensuring effective integration and collaboration among these critical divisions. By uniting these teams under Ericka’s leadership, we are better positioned to work together with our members across our constituencies, achieve our goals, and propel students into opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericka brings to the College Board a wealth of experience and a track record of delivering access and opportunity to students. Throughout her career, she has taken on complex, highly visible projects and worked with a range of stakeholders to deliver results. She has managed large teams across many disciplines, including strategic planning, public policy development and advocacy, executive recruitment, and fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericka joins the College Board from the U.S. Department of Education, where she served as Senior Advisor to Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. In that role, she led cross-agency teams working on issues that included higher education funding and grant-making. Prior to her work at the Department, Ericka served as the Vice President for Operations and Strategic Leadership for The Education Trust, a renowned national education nonprofit. As chief operating officer for Ed Trust, she ensured the effective development and implementation of a 10-year strategic plan, led a comprehensive board development process, and guided the organization through a significant period of growth, which included the establishment of a new state office and three supporting organizations. Under her leadership, Ed Trust was recognized as a &lt;em&gt;Great Place to Work&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Washingtonian&lt;/em&gt; magazine. Other previous roles included Vice President and Director at the executive search firm Isaacson, Miller, where she led the K-12 education practice, and the McKenzie Group (now part of American Institutes for Research), where she served as President and COO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericka earned her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University and her master’s and doctoral degrees in English literature from Stanford University. She is a former English professor at Mills College in Oakland where she taught American literature and persuasive writing. Ericka was born and raised in Alexandria, Va., and still considers the T. C. Williams Titans her favorite sports team. She enjoys active travel, community service, and following the teenage adventures of her twin nephews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What drew you to the College Board?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;I’m drawn to the College Board for a number of reasons. Initially I was drawn to the organization because I have tremendous respect for its influence, reach, and reputation for producing high-quality work. There are many organizations that promote opportunity, access, and success for students as they consider and pursue postsecondary education, but I can’t think of another organization that has the ability to engage so many actors in this effort — students, parents, teachers, counselors, secondary school administrators, college and university administrators and faculty, policymakers — all of whom are critically important when it comes to ensuring that all students acquire the knowledge and skills to succeed in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;I was also drawn to the mission of challenging all students to own their future, because it’s powerful and it rings true. I first encountered the College Board when I was a young person taking the PSAT/NMSQT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, and I remember how meaningful that experience was for me. I grew up with parents who expected me to go to college, but it wasn’t until I took the test that I truly began to own that decision. It wasn’t until that moment that I saw myself as a person preparing for college, and I became acutely aware that what I did from that point on to prepare myself for college mattered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What excites you most about your new role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;I’m excited that it brings together three very important functions — membership, governance, higher education — that are related but have the potential to be more integrated. There’s creative opportunity in that challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;I’m also looking forward to working closely with so many of our external partners — member organizations, Trustees, council members, postsecondary institutions — in our effort to achieve greater educational equity. To be able to tap into their wisdom and experience, and then help us maximize the potential of these partnerships toward a common goal, is tremendously exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the most critical issue in education that needs to be addressed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;There are so many important issues that need to be addressed, but I think one of the most critical is ensuring that we instill in young people a hunger for learning at an early age and continue to stoke that fire with challenging, engaging content taught effectively, all the while holding ourselves and our students to high standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;One discouraging experience can extinguish a student’s academic confidence in an instant. We need to be mindful of that. But conversely, in an instant, a positive experience, reinforced and nurtured over time, can lead that student to realize that he is capable of more than he imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;Many years ago, when I was a graduate student writing my dissertation, I decided that I needed to do something to break up the monotony of sitting behind a computer all day, every day. I needed to do something that had a practical application that would remind me why I decided to embark on this journey to an English literature Ph.D. in the first place. So I signed up to teach middle school language arts in an after-school program in East Palo Alto, California, just down the road from Stanford University, where I was a student, but in many ways half a world away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;Unlike Palo Alto, East Palo Alto was quite economically depressed, and the students I taught — all students of color — came from families with limited financial resources. One day I decided to teach a chapter from Zora Neale Hurston’s autobiography &lt;em&gt;Dust Tracks on a Road,&lt;/em&gt; the chapter in which Hurston talks about her experience going to college as a young African American woman in the early 1900s. At one point I said to the class, matter-of-factly, “So, when you go to college….” I remember so many of the students looking at me as if I had said “Mars” instead of “college.” Many of them laughed. One student asked me, “What’s college?” And when she asked me that question, I knew in that moment how different the trajectory of her life was going to be from mine unless she not only understood what college was but knew that she could aspire to it. Perhaps that experience more than any other inspired me to make my life’s work education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can the College Board and its membership best address this issue?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;By reaching out and finding that student I just mentioned, making her aware that college is within her reach, giving her the tools to prepare for college, encouraging her to strive for higher learning and ensuring that challenging content is there to meet her, and then making colleges aware that she is prepared to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a former English lit professor, what was your favorite book to teach and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;One of my favorite books to teach was W. E. B. Du Bois’s &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Souls of Black Folk.&lt;/em&gt; I found it interesting to teach because it’s a text that is simultaneously and profoundly literary, lyrical, historical, and political. As a result, there are so many different points of engagement for the reader. I loved seeing students grapple with the challenging subjects such as race, class, and culture through these various lenses — and seeing which they chose as their point of entry into the text. I always found the student papers written about &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Souls of Black Folk&lt;/em&gt; among the most interesting, original, and enjoyable to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under your leadership, Ed Trust was recognized as a Great Place to Work by &lt;em&gt;Washingtonian&lt;/em&gt; magazine. What’s your secret?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;Oh gosh, no secret really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;But one of the first things I did when I got to the Ed Trust is go on a listening tour. I spoke with every single person in the organization and asked two questions: What do you think works well in the organization and what would you like to see us do better? I then analyzed the data and proposed to my colleagues a strategy for maintaining our strengths and prioritizing our areas in need of improvement. With organizational buy-in on the strategy, we then built the operational infrastructure to help us reach those goals and hired some wonderfully smart, talented, hardworking people along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;In addition to ensuring that we were operationally sound, we worked hard to ensure that our work — programmatically and operationally — was appropriately integrated, from long-term strategic planning to day-to-day decision making. But I want to stress that we worked on it. It didn’t happen overnight, and we never achieved perfection. But I can say with confidence that with each passing year we got better. The Great Place to Work recognition was special because it was our staff telling us they felt we were a great place to work. So it helped us know we were moving in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We know you like to travel; tell us about your most recent trip. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.25in&quot;&gt;My most recent trip was a five-day cycling adventure in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in North and South Carolina. We did about 40 to 45 miles each day with pretty steep elevation gain, most of the time in 95-degree heat. It was fun, and the scenery was beautiful. I enjoy a physical challenge, but typically I choose my climate more wisely. Lesson learned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Getting to Know Ericka Miller, College Board&amp;#039;s new Chief of Membership, Governance, and Higher Education&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The Academic Assembly is charged with considering issues and actions related to providing universal access to high standards of learning. During the AAC’s most recent meeting, the council discussed several important issues and programmatic developments, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The role of professional development at the College Board&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The development of a high-quality, innovative program at the College Board that supports rigorous instructional opportunities for students in grades 6–12&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communications around the redesigned SAT&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Member engagement and delegate outreach&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The council also discussed possible speakers, discussion points, and session topics for College Board Forum 2014. Pam Paulson and Michael McDonough, chair and chair-elect of the AAC, discuss the work of the council below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;College Board All Access (CBAA)&lt;/strong&gt;: What are the top priorities of the Academic Assembly and how do they reflect major issues affecting academic professionals right now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pam Paulson (PP):&lt;/strong&gt; The top issues span a large range because education is a complex system that is connected or disconnected across the country, across grades pre-K–16, across disciplines, and even involving partnerships with outside institutions. If this enterprise wants our country to thrive and continue to innovate, all of our students must succeed and have the ability to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We must be concerned with both the students who are struggling and the students who are doing well. Both groups need to have the right amount of challenge and support to continue growing. Teachers are tasked with the enormous responsibility of educating all students in preparation for being contributing citizens who lead productive, fulfilled lives. This makes teacher preparation and professional development central issues in the education system. High-quality instruction that meets students’ needs leads to successful learners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to understand student academic performance and growth is to gather information from external measures of student achievement. The College Board offers high-quality tests and courses like SAT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and AP&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; that give students a sense of how they are doing on rigorous exams at a point in time. Academic achievement also includes continuous improvement so that students learn how to improve their work along the way — getting feedback to understand what they know and what they still need to learn. Feedback from their teacher, from experts in the field, from peers, even from self-assessments of their work can help students reflect and refine their thinking and skill development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is one reason the College Board is developing the AP Capstone™ program and diploma — to give students another way to learn from assessments and demonstrate their achievements. The Capstone project uses multiple forms of ongoing data to help students better understand their level of accomplishment and need. Students need to be inspired to do their best, and information about their progress is a key component of keeping them engaged in their own learning and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CBAA: &lt;/strong&gt;Talk about some key takeaways from the council meeting. Were there any surprises throughout the discussions? Any topics that were particularly divisive among council members?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael McDonough (MM):&lt;/strong&gt; At the most recent council meeting, members identified and discussed a number of engaging and timely topics. There was a dynamic conversation regarding how to better collaborate with members, especially during program redesign and draft assessments. Although much of this conversation focused on AP assessments, members were clear to identify other opportunities for enhanced collaboration and partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members also discussed the College Board’s significant capacity to report on a wide range of student data points. Members reviewed some initial data regarding community college retention, transfer, and completion, insisting that more focused analysis is needed, and that our language in framing and reporting this data not privilege one sector over another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the other wide-ranging discussions, four themes or topics seemed to emerge: the passionate support for access and equity; the strong advocacy for professional development opportunities at all levels; the sustained focus on supporting academic rigor; and the building interest in designing robust and transparent pathways for students as they transition into high school, college, or career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CBAA:&lt;/strong&gt; Are there any new topics on the horizon that committee members can expect to see on the agenda for the next meeting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PP&lt;/strong&gt;: As the Academic Council council, we are involved in gathering information to provide insights and advice as the College Board develops new academic initiatives or refines existing programs. Our involvement often is in an inquiry format as we ask questions meant to stimulate thinking about what is possible, what might be challenging when the programs actually get into schools, and what might be unforeseen issues. One area we know will capture our attention is diversity as we spend time asking how we can reach and teach all students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MM: &lt;/strong&gt;Assembly members are hoping to see more presentations and vigorous conversation regarding data analysis, especially related to the community college sector and to student success; to hear more about the emerging initiative in career technical education, and to help shape a more collaborative culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PP: &lt;/strong&gt;The future of this country and the world is dependent on an educated population. We cannot afford to educate only some of our students. In order to continue creating and making innovative products and services, we need to tap into the interests and talents of each student. This means we are interested in a broad range of opportunities for students to find their strengths and passions and consider their possibilities. Each of the disciplines brings something to the education of our students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By bringing together subject-area experts and regional leaders at council meetings, we can spend time thinking about how the interaction and combination of academic disciplines in the education system makes for an even more powerful education for our students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Academic Assembly Council Focuses on Instruction and Professional Development During Recent Meeting&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
