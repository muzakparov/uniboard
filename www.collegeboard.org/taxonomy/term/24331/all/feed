&lt;p&gt;Here are some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board hosted its second annual Virginia AP Day in Richmond to recognize the achievement of five Commonwealth divisions being named to the AP District Honor Roll. Governor Terry McAuliffe presented each division with an award and met with students, including two who were invited to present to the House Education Committee. Students, teachers, and administrators also had the opportunity to discuss their AP experiences with Steven Staples, Superintendent of Public Instruction, and Holly Coy and Nathalie Molliet-Ribet, Deputy Secretaries of Education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky issued a gubernatorial proclamation declaring February 23 “AP Recognition Day.” The state’s first AP Day included legislative visits for students and teachers, acknowledgement in the House and Senate chambers, and a formal recognition ceremony hosted by the Commissioner of Education and the Deputy Secretary of Education and Workforce to honor Kentucky’s eight winning AP District Honor Roll districts. Kentucky’s Teacher of the Year, Ron Skillern—who happens to be an AP U.S. Government and Politics instructor—joined as a special guest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Texas, AP students and teachers were honored from the floors of both the House of Representatives and Senate. New York AP students were greeted at the Capitol by Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan and Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul, who encouraged students by saying, “The effort you’re putting in now in high school to obtain a college-level education is going to help you in a 1,000 different ways that you don’t know right now, including helping you save money towards college tuition later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students and educators in Austin spoke animatedly about how AP has touched their lives. A student from Katy High School remarked, “I’ve been able to explore a lot of subjects in a controlled environment, where all my teachers are there to support me. It makes me feel like I’m really prepared to go out into the real world.” Brenham High School Coach Trenton Hall discussed the importance of bringing AP Computer Science courses to his school to ensure that students earn college credit for the great work they are doing already—this year they used a 3D printer to create prosthetic hands for children in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maggie Wolf from Tomball High School in Texas was excited to participate in AP Day and see how her voice can help raise awareness around the importance of the AP program. Alexander Verdieu from the High School for Enterprise, Business, and Technology in New York City believes that taking AP Calculus will help him know what to expect when he gets to college. An AP Calculus AB and BC teacher from Texas expressed the same sentiment. Her eyes welled up with tears when she explained that her AP students come back each year to tell her how prepared they felt for college and marveled. “It never gets old,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;AP Day Celebrated in the Kentucky, New York, Texas, and Virginia State Legislatures&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
