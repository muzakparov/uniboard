&lt;p&gt;“I know that means I have to go to law school but I believe people should go after what they really want,” she says. “I want something out of life!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pursing her dreams has always been a mantra for Mrs. Cleveland, who has juggled the demanding roles of wife, mother, and adult learner while being a student at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC). She credits her accomplishment in part to the staff of the College Board’s Educational Opportunity Center (EOC) office in Washington D.C. She is particularly appreciative of the assistance she received from her counselor, Melvin Brock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am so grateful God put Mr. Melvin Brock in my life,” she explains. “I would tell anyone who is an adult learner to see him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brock, who has been a counselor at the Washington office for 16 years, says Mrs. Cleveland is representative of the typical adult learner that the EOC has served over the past four decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “Many have not been in school for a while. Many have had interrupted educational journeys,” Brock says. But he said he sensed something special in Mrs. Cleveland. “Despite the fact that she had a lot of competing responsibilities and was older, I could see her desire to complete her education.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road to earning her degree was a long and difficult one for the long time DC resident. The ninth of twelve children in a farming family in Sedalia, N.C., Cleveland dealt with medical issues growing up. She eventually graduated from high school and received a trip to Washington as a gift from a local minister. She never left.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That was in the mid-sixties,” she says. “When I got to D.C., I stayed and worked for the military at the Navy Yard. I got married, had two girls and adopted a boy. My husband worked for the military too. At that time I wanted to get a teaching degree but family issues got in the way for a while,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Cleveland kept her dreams of staying in the education field alive by serving as a teacher’s aide in the D.C. public schools. She was eventually encouraged by the late Dr. Floretta McKenzie, who was superintendent of D.C. Public Schools at the time – and a former director of the EOC – to reengage with her schooling, and she completed work on child care certificate programs at Howard University and at the University of the District of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 70s she enrolled in a teacher education program at UDC, but had to stop again as a series of life challenges— including the loss of a child and other family health issues—intervened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years ago things began to settle down for Mrs. Cleveland and she once again turned her energies to her education. That’s when she connected with Mr. Brock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was touched by her story,” Brock said. “I knew that money was a big issue. I knew about a small program run by the District of Columbia Consolidation for Educational Services (a professional association of D.C.&#039;s TRIO programs personnel).  So I nominated her for a scholarship for books and she won that award. That helped her get back on track. She started school again in the fall of the 2010-2011 academic year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she prepared to start work on her degree, Cleveland was initially frustrated by the forms required to apply for financial aid, but Brock helped her navigate the confusing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She said to me ‘They act like you are supposed to know how to do this already.’  So I told her ‘Let’s get it done,’” he said. “We worked through the documentation, the admission issues, and the financial aid process and got her admitted with advanced standing to the criminal justice program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleveland chose criminal justice as her major because of law enforcement experiences she’s had in her own community. “&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have been a block captain. I have worked with the security teams in public schools. I have an understanding of the field,” she said. “So, I want to become a lawyer and perhaps a judge …one day….it’s all part of my dream….my ultimate goal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleveland says it hasn’t been easy being a student at her age and she’s faced some hardships, but she’s making the most of the experience. She’s taking six credit hours in her current semester and hopes to earn her BA by 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to search your heart first. When you go back, you don’t have time to mess around. Go after what you really want,” she said. “I’ve had financial challenges and family responsibilities that sometimes held me up. I’ve only had two experiences of discrimination against me because of my age and both instances involved professors. Now, however, when I am sitting outside the classroom waiting, the kids at the main campus of UDC all sit around me on the floor. They call me ‘Grandma or Aunt.’ There is so much respect. When we have to do group work, they reach out. They ask for advice about bustin’ out them A’s.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;In Profile: An Interview with Ms. Garie Cleveland, an EOC Adult Learner&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
