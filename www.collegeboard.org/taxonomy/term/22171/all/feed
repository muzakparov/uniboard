The launch comes just over a year after the College Board announced a landmark partnership with Khan Academy, a leader in online education. The partnership announcement was a part of the College Board’s introduction of sweeping changes to the SAT, including a move away from obscure “SAT vocabulary words” to the use of relevant vocabulary words in context, an in-depth focus on essential areas of math, and the elimination of the guessing penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interactive practice tools are designed to help level the playing field for students who are interested in taking the SAT and preparing for college-level courses. Unlike traditional high-priced test prep that focuses on strategies for taking the test and quick cramming, Official SAT Practice supports and reinforces what students are learning in classrooms by helping them focus on the knowledge and skills most essential for college readiness. Official SAT Practice is available today for free, exclusively from the College Board and Khan Academy. It is designed to easily be used by students, families, schools, community organizations, and after-school programs — anytime, anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The College Board redesigned the SAT to better deliver to students the opportunities they have earned through hard work in their classes,” said College Board President and CEO David Coleman. “We are equally committed to enhancing instruction and providing resources for students who are behind. There’s no better practitioner of world-class, high-quality instruction for all students at all levels than Khan Academy — and their material just happens to be free. That’s why we are partnering for the first time ever to level the college assessment practice field, and to go beyond test prep by offering content that will also reinforce classroom work and enhance college readiness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our mission at Khan Academy is a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere, and college readiness is a crucial part of that,” said Khan Academy Founder and Executive Director Sal Khan. “We want to help as many students as possible prepare for college and for life, and since the SAT measures preparedness for college, our partnership with the College Board is a natural fit. We’re excited to join the College Board in empowering all students with world-class tools. And we’re committed to building the best SAT resource available — not just the best free resource, but the best resource, period.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting on June 2, students can access Official SAT Practice on KhanAcademy.org and find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detailed information about the redesigned SAT, including thousands of practice questions written in partnership with the same developers creating the new exam, explanations of each section of the test, and guidance on interpreting test scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interactive questions, video lessons, and reference articles made in partnership with the College Board to help students practice and review the skills that research shows are essential for college readiness and that are tested on the SAT in both Math and Evidence-Based Reading and Writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short diagnostic quizzes in both Math and Evidence-Based Reading and Writing to help students identify the skills they should focus on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personalized practice recommendations, directly tied to specific skills on the test, to make the biggest impact on student performance and overall college readiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four official full-length practice tests written by the College Board, so students can see detailed results of their work and Khan Academy can direct them to the most appropriate materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instant feedback on their answers so that students are always learning and seeing their progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study tips and suggestions for test day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help as many students as possible take advantage of these SAT practice tools, the College Board and Khan Academy are working with community groups, school districts and educators, and college access organizations to incorporate Official SAT Practice into the ongoing work they’re doing to prepare students for college. A crucial partner in this work is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bgca.org/&quot;&gt;Boys &amp;amp; Girls Clubs of America (BGCA)&lt;/a&gt;. Serving more than four million members annually at 4,100 Club locations, BGCA has unparalleled ability to reach students — especially those without a computer, Internet access, or a safe place to study. Five Club locations have already started using the SAT practice tools in a small pilot and BGCA is planning a larger pilot program over the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For more than a century, Boys &amp;amp; Girls Clubs have played a significant role in helping kids and teens achieve academic success through year-round programs designed to help them graduate high school, pursue a college degree, and join the work force,” said Dr. Damon Williams, chief educational and youth development officer at BGCA. “Through the support of Khan Academy and the College Board, our Club teens will now have access to more cutting-edge tools and training to ensure a great future is within their grasp.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming months, the College Board and Khan Academy will continue to enhance these practice tools based on feedback from students, parents, and educators, adding new features such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional practice tests and practice questions created jointly by Khan Academy and the College Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new mobile app from the College Board that will enable students to take an SAT practice test on paper, then instantly scan it and get their score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scaled scoring for practice tests so students can see an estimate of the score they might receive on the real test and track their growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A way for students to upload their PSAT scores to Khan Academy to get an even more personalized SAT practice experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The College Board and Khan Academy will continue to provide updates as additional features become available.&lt;/p&gt;

It has been an important part of the college admission process for millions of students since its introduction in 1926, and it remains an important part of that process today. As the former head of undergraduate admission at Stanford University, Occidental College, and Vassar College, I’ve seen firsthand how SAT scores and high school grades combine to become a strong predictor of first-year college success. And soon, the SAT will have an even stronger connection to the work that students are doing in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning next spring, students who take the SAT will see a new version of the test. Before redesigning the test, the College Board looked at the research that shows what skills and knowledge students need to know to be ready for college and career. We also listened to feedback from students, parents, teachers, and college and university professionals. The result is a test that is more useful, focused, and clear than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the changes that students taking the test in March 2016 and anytime thereafter should be aware of include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Content that is better aligned to what they’re already learning in class. Now there’s a clearer connection between what students are learning in school and the skills and knowledge we’re assessing on the SAT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A focus on the areas of math that research has shown to be most important for college success. For example, proportions and algebraic linear equations will be on the test; logic puzzles that have little connection to the math students are learning in class will not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A focus on vocabulary that students are likely to use again in college and career. Two words students won’t see on the test: “prevaricator” and “sagacious.” They may see a word like “synthesis,” however, which is used often in the contexts of chemistry, philosophy, biology, and psychiatry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No penalty for guessing. Students will earn points for the questions they get right — but won’t have points subtracted if they choose the wrong answer. There are also fewer answer options for multiple-choice questions — four, instead of five — so students making an educated guess are more likely to choose the correct answer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The College Board wants every student to have an equal opportunity to practice for the redesigned SAT, regardless of their financial situation. That’s why we’ve teamed up with Khan Academy®, a leader in online education, to provide all students with high-quality, personalized SAT practice absolutely free. This partnership will level the playing field by providing official SAT study tools to all students who want them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official SAT Practice — which launched in early June — is an interactive experience that identifies the areas individual students need to work on based on how they answer short quizzes and official SAT sample questions. It then tailors a study plan for each student and provides instant feedback so students can know how they’re doing and be proud of the progress they’re making. Of course, the best way to practice for the new SAT is to take challenging courses in high school and work hard in those courses. Official SAT Practice is intended to reinforce the great work already being done in class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer is a time to relax, read for pleasure, and recharge. It’s also a great time for students to explore Official SAT Practice. We look forward to seeing these students — and all students who follow — benefit from the changes we’ve made to the SAT and succeed in college, career, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Partners that Make the College Board Stronger</title>

&lt;p&gt;One of those partners that make us stronger is bringing the U.S. Constitution to life with technology. Jeffrey Rosen, president and CEO of the National Constitution Center, has led the development of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution&quot;&gt;Interactive Constitution&lt;/a&gt;. With this innovative tool, students can explore the historic roots of each amendment, compare U.S. and international protections, and read opposing views to the interpretation of each amendment. “I believe this exercise of civil discourse does have the potential to transform constitutional education in America,” said Rosen.  AP U.S. History teachers are already using this tool, and Rosen hopes all students will use the Interactive Constitution to learn about history and become more informed citizens.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman also introduced Fidel Vargas, president and CEO of the Hispanic Scholarship Fund (HSF), as the “leader of a revolutionary effort engaging students in their work.”  HSF uses data from the PSAT/NMSQT to identify Hispanic students for scholarship opportunities. Vargas pointed out that one thing that often gets overlooked is that 93 percent of Latinos under the age of 18 living in the United States are U.S. citizens, and that’s important to keep in mind when considering the country’s future. To date, HSF has awarded more than half a billion dollars to over 6,500 Latino students and alumni.  “As a nation, whether we are training leaders to go into politics or into science or into law, there is a training and a mentorship that in some ways has been lost,” said Vargas, “so it’s not just the scholarships we give these students, it’s the support — the mentorship we are providing — that is making the real difference in accelerating their career paths.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another man focused on propelling careers forward is Hadi Partovi, co-founder and CEO of Code.org, another College Board partner. “Hadi has an ambitious and timely agenda that is sweeping this country,” said Coleman. After Partovi introduced a program titled “One Hour of Code,” in which any school in America can receive a free, 60-minute video tutorial on how to code, students have clocked more than 100 million hours of code in the past two years. “Every single child should learn about algorithmic thinking or how the Internet works — it’s just a basic thing that every child in the 21st century should have as part of their well-rounded education,” said Partovi. More than 5 million students took the tutorial, 2 million of whom were girls. Since launching our partnership with Code.org, over 90 school districts nationwide have added computer science courses, and the enrollment in AP Computer Science A has almost doubled, making it the fastest-growing course for the College Board.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Coleman, partnerships are about not only enhancing the College Board’s services to students and families but also offering support to institutions that can benefit from the collaboration.  “Assessment without opportunity is dead,” said Coleman in his closing remarks, “but with these kinds of partners, the College Board can share very powerful things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;The Partners that Make the College Board Stronger&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Consequently, we were very happy to see Nicole Hurd, founder and CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;http://advisingcorps.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;College Advising Corps&lt;/a&gt; (CAC), interviewed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hulu.com/charlie-rose&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charlie Rose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last month. Hurd appeared on the popular PBS talk show to discuss the importance of higher education advising for low-income, first-generation, and underrepresented students, and how her organization is making a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How CAC works:&lt;/strong&gt; Recent college graduates are trained as college advisers and placed in U.S. high schools to work alongside school counselors to provide free, near-peer college advising to high-need students as they navigate the college planning and application process.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to reach more students, CAC is adding digital advising to the mix by participating in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bloomberg Philanthropies&lt;/a&gt;’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegepoint.info/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CollegePoint virtual advising initiative&lt;/a&gt; — a free program supported by the College Board. CAC is one of several nonprofit organizations that provide trained advisers to be matched with high-achieving, low- or moderate-income students who choose to participate in the program. These advisers supplement but do not replace the critical role of school counselors by communicating with advisees via phone, email, text message, and video chat. This makes it easy for students to get help with the college planning and application process anytime, anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, two years after Hurd launched the College Guide program that was to become College Advising Corps, the program received a grant from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jkcf.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jack Kent Cooke Foundation&lt;/a&gt; — also a College Board partner. To date, CAC has served more than 543,000 students in 14 states in both urban and rural communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The College Board has partnered with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.learninglist.com/&quot;&gt;Learning List&lt;/a&gt;, an independent instructional materials review service for schools and districts, to ensure that the materials included on the example textbook lists for the following AP subjects are aligned to the curriculum frameworks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure the quality of its reviews, Learning List hired as its reviewers many of the AP teachers who helped the College Board develop the new curriculum frameworks. As this brief &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-HLtVRWxt0&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; explains, three reviews are provided for each instructional material: (1) an overview of the material’s key academic and technology attributes; (2) an in-depth analysis of the material’s instructional content and design; and (3) a review of the material’s alignment to the Learning Objectives, Essential Knowledge statements, and Practices/Skills for the course. Beyond helping educators select new AP instructional materials, the reviews and tools on LearningList.com offer AP teachers ongoing support in using their materials effectively.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Learning List: Helping Identify the Best AP Instructional Materials for Your Course&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Fresno Unified, the largest school district in the Central Valley, has taken an “all-in approach” to preparing its students for success after high school. To ensure that all juniors have the opportunity to benefit from the SAT, the district is administering the college entrance exam at every one of its high schools on Tuesday, April 12. Students will take the SAT during the school day for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Shott, a local continuation high school student who is participating in this year’s SAT School Day administration, told reporter Juanita Stevenson, “The fact that Fresno Unified is letting this continuation school take the SAT for the first time — it shows that they haven’t really given up on us yet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help these students feel confident walking into the test, the district has also partnered with the College Board, Khan Academy, and the Boys and Girls Club to offer free online tutoring. Students have been busy preparing with Khan Academy’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;free practice tools&lt;/a&gt; during the school day and then seamlessly continuing their practice after school at three local Boys and Girls Clubs. Thanks to a donation of 94 computers to these Clubs, even students who do not have a computer or access to the internet at home have the chance to practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s about access, and giving all kids a fair shake,” Superintendent Mike Hansen told Juanita Stevenson. He hopes that that this approach of removing barriers will encourage Fresno Unified students to take advantage of the opportunity to succeed. “We want them to know — as a superintendent, as a board, as principals, teachers, educators, as a community — we believe in you, we know you can do it. It’s sitting right in front of you. Come do it. Write your own ticket.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NICOLE HURD, College Advising Corps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;The national average ratio of guidance counselors to public high school students is 1 to 471; in California, it’s 1 to 1,000. Compounding the issue, counselors in modest and poor districts are evaluated based on whether their students finish high school, not whether they apply to and succeed in college. And, of course, wealthy districts have more advisers than poor ones, which means that the kids who could use the most help are getting the least. Hurd founded the College Advising Corps to address the problem. A national service organization, the CAC recruits recent college graduates and deploys them to high schools with high numbers of low-income students. Think Teach for America, but for counseling—and with some important differences. CAC advisers overwhelmingly resemble the students they help: 66 percent are underrepresented minorities, 62 percent were eligible for Pell Grants in college, and 54 percent were the first in their families to go to college. They’re not taking anyone’s job: they’re on the payroll of the university they graduated from, with their salaries coming half from the university and half from a mix of philanthropic and public sources. The goal is to work with teachers, counselors, and principals to create a culture in which kids expect to go to college. Hurd recalls getting a call from a principal gushing about a CAC adviser. The adviser had found that many of her students refused to engage with the admissions process because they didn’t know anyone who’d ever gone to college. So she convinced the school’s teachers to put signs on their classroom doors showing not only their name, but also their alma mater—a small but meaningful way to make students realize that they were surrounded by people who had gone to college. The CAC can point to more concrete results, too. Over the past two years, college enrollment rates in its New York City partner schools have gone up by 35 percent. But Hurd knows the organization can’t single-handedly solve the college-advising crisis. “That’s not going to happen without public investment,” she says. “Part of our goal is to execute with excellence and keep proving to everybody that this works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAN PORTERFIELD, Franklin &amp;amp; Marshall College&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;Can a selective liberal arts college triple its share of low-income students in a few years without sacrificing academic quality? The example of Franklin &amp;amp; Marshall suggests that the answer is yes. Since Porterfield became president in 2011, Pell-eligible students have gone from 5 percent of the student body to 19 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;That’s one result of the ambitious Next Generation Initiative, a multipronged effort to boost Franklin &amp;amp; Marshall’s socioeconomic, racial, and geographic diversity. The college has eliminated so-called merit aid, which overwhelmingly goes to students who can afford tuition, and doubled its spending on need-based aid. It hosts a three-week summer prep program for high-achieving, low-income high school seniors from urban charter networks and rural Pennsylvania schools. And each year the school accepts two ten-student cohorts from the Posse Foundation, a nonprofit focused on college access. Porterfield is especially proud that these students are actually improving the academic environment. First-generation students and Pell Grant recipients have the same average grades as the overall student body, and students who get need-based aid are graduating at a higher rate, with higher GPAs, than the school as a whole. The college says it has gotten more selective, not less, since it started the initiative. To Porterfield, that makes it an obvious win-win. “I wish I could tell you that I was facing competition from ten other top schools,” he says. “But the reality is, these students are under-recruited.” Once on campus, they raise the bar for everyone. “Education is one endeavor where everybody wins if you give low-income kids an opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 30, the White House named three College Board partners “Champions of Change for College Opportunity”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.collegeaccess.org/AccessUpdateArchive&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kim Cook&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of the National College Access Network&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ednc.org/2016/09/30/white-house-names-college-advising-corps-founder-ceo-nicole-hurd-champion-change-college-opportunity/?utm_content=buffer48203&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_campaign=buffer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nicole Hurd&lt;/a&gt;, founder and chief executive officer of the College Advising Corps&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fandm.edu/news/latest-news/2016/09/27/f-m-s-president-porterfield-named-a-white-house-champion-of-change-for-college-opportunity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Daniel Porterfield&lt;/a&gt;, president of Franklin &amp;amp; Marshall College and College Board trustee&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/09/27/recognizing-college-opportunity-champions-change&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;White House blog&lt;/a&gt;, these individuals were honored “for their leadership and tireless work to expand opportunity for students from all backgrounds to advance to and through college.”&lt;/p&gt;

In a conversation at the College Board’s Forum, Hurd, alongside College Board President and CEO David Coleman and Congressman Joaquin Castro, discussed how to partner with school counselors to help every student succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hurd started College Advising Corps to build upon the great work school counselors do every day to advance students along the opportunity pathway. They place well-trained, recent college graduates as full-time college advisers in high schools across the country. Making sure students reach the critical milestones research shows will get them to successfully matriculate is a priority for the organization. Activities like applying to 3-5 match colleges and completing the FAFSA have become key metrics that College Advising Corps uses to evaluate their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s about personalized, thoughtful advising that gets students to a place where they are going to succeed,” Hurd said. “How can we hold a young person’s hand and pull them through that door of opportunity?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Castro, who has supported school counselors through his policy work and public service, cited the importance of an infrastructure that guides students to college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are important things that happen inside the school, but outside the classroom,” Castro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked how Forum audience members could help support school counselors and get more of their students to college, Hurd in turn posed a question: Are we saying yes enough? She challenged attendees to say yes to those who come to us asking for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To close out the plenary, Coleman announced that the College Board and College Advising Corps will bestow an annual award to a school counselor who “blows us away” with their dedication and commitment to the students in their care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myliss Parker, Director of Advanced Academics at Los Fresnos Consolidated Independent School District in Texas, was the first recipient of this honor. A fierce advocate for getting her students into higher education, she has focused much of her work on addressing summer melt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m extremely humbled by this honor,” Parker said. “God has blessed me to work with wonderful, wonderful students, but even more the young people that have been sent to my district [through College Advising Corps].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Are We Saying Yes Enough?

&lt;p&gt;Analytical writing is a key skill in a student&#039;s academic and career pursuits. The Atlantic &amp;amp; College Board Writing Prize encourages students to apply this skill as they make connections between important historical texts and their own experiences and communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winner will be selected from seven finalists — one from each of six U.S. College Board regions and one international. Six of the finalists will each receive $2,500 in prize money, and the overall winner will have his or her essay published in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; and receive $5,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Submissions will be accepted from Jan. 1 to Feb. 28, 2015. More information about the selected documents, contest rules, and timeline is available at &lt;strong&gt;collegeboardwritingprize.org&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Announcing The Atlantic &amp;amp; College Board Writing Prize&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The organizations are bringing together the successes of the Advanced Placement Program&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (AP&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;) and PLTW’s applied learning programs — both of which are shown to improve student outcomes and help ensure successful transitions to college and career. Through the partnership, the organizations will develop college and career pathways built around PLTW’s existing program pathways — engineering, biomedical science, and computer science — by combining AP courses with PLTW courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership creates an opportunity for students to earn credentials that signify their readiness for college and careers, and participate in career-focused opportunities such as internships and scholarships. These recognition opportunities for students will be available beginning in summer 2016. Additionally, schools will receive credentials when they bring together AP and PLTW courses in a meaningful way for students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To compete in the global marketplace, students need access to challenging course work that will prepare them for college and career success in these critical fields. By harnessing the positive impact of Advanced Placement and Project Lead The Way’s applied learning programs, this new partnership will provide students with clear and comprehensive pathways to pursue a wide range of STEM degrees and careers,” said College Board President and CEO David Coleman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLTW and the College Board recognize the importance of preparing more students, earlier, to pursue high-demand degrees and careers. By the year 2020, almost two-thirds of jobs, and nearly all high-paying jobs, will require postsecondary education or training.&lt;a href=&quot;#_ftn1&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;_ftnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; By 2018, 92 percent of traditional science, technology, engineering, and math jobs will be for those with at least some postsecondary education and training. Increasingly, career readiness is dependent on postsecondary success.&lt;a href=&quot;#_ftn2&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref2&quot; title=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;_ftnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This partnership combines the strengths of two leading organizations to create immense value for students, schools, and the broader workforce,” said PLTW President and CEO Dr. Vince Bertram. “Through rigorous K–12 curriculum, quality teacher professional development, and widely accepted postsecondary credit opportunities, students and schools will set themselves apart as vital assets to postsecondary institutions and employers across the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLTW and the College Board’s long-term partnership will develop college and career pathways in engineering, biomedical science, and computer science by combining AP courses with PLTW programs. Each pathway will emphasize applied learning and consist of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLTW courses that introduce all students to the field.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AP courses that provide an opportunity for college credit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLTW specialization courses that focus on knowledge and skills needed for rewarding careers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The College Board is also in the process of exploring the development of new AP courses to support the pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through these initiatives, PLTW and the College Board aim to expand access to challenging course work that gives all students an opportunity at college and career success.&lt;/p&gt;

The new partnership will make computing accessible for all students and empower them to develop skills critical to many 21st century careers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jobs in computing-related fields are growing at four times the national average, and the 600,000 open computing jobs in the United States pay, on average, 85 percent more than the national median wage. Yet, less than 2.4 percent of college students graduate with computer science degrees, and underrepresented minorities and women continue to have a minimal presence in the field. Of the 2.1 million software professionals in the United States, only 26 percent are women. The College Board is actively seeking to identify and promote high quality resources from a range of organizations committed to addressing this diversity issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the partnership between the College Board and Code.org, many schools will begin offering, for the first time, high-quality computer science courses that will expand the diversity of students who develop interest and readiness for critical 21st century careers that require computing skills. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The College Board and Code.org will identify and help schools to adopt two specific computer science courses at the high school level:&lt;ul style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exploring Computer Science: A course accessible for all students, designed to stimulate interest in the field and instill the basic knowledge and skills essential for subsequent enrollment in related AP courses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AP&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;®&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Computer Science Principles: A new AP course that will debut in fall 2016, providing students with the chance to earn college credit for mastery of an array of computing principles and activities.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The College Board and Code.org will co-fund Code.org’s professional development of new computer science teachers, and will recommend the Code.org computer science course pathway;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The College Board and Code.org will encourage schools to administer the new PSAT™ 8/9 assessment as a way of identifying more students, particularly those from traditionally under-represented groups, for enrollment in these new courses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many underrepresented minority and female students never know of their potential for success in challenging computer science course work, and most schools do not offer these students access to college or career opportunities in computer science. Among the high school graduating class of 2014 who took the PSAT/NMSQT®, more than 165,000 female students demonstrated potential for success in AP Computer Science, but only 2.5 percent of these students gained access to the AP Computer Science A course and exam. Among black and Hispanic students, more than 33,000 students demonstrated potential for success in AP Computer Science, but only 4.7 percent of these students gained access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a nation, we must do more to cultivate an interest in computer science among students of all backgrounds and ensure that they have the preparation to pursue the computing jobs that will help power future economic growth,” said David Coleman, College Board President and CEO. The College Board is committed to providing students who have worked hard, and who have proved their potential, with access to the opportunities they’ve earned and to challenging them to own their future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board plans to endorse Code.org’s instructional resources for AP Computer Science Principles, and in preparation for the debut of the new AP Computer Science Principles course in fall 2016, Code.org will help high schools across 35 of the largest school districts in the country to pilot its  Computer Science Principles curriculum this fall, particularly in urban public school districts such as New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership builds on the success of Code.org’s learning platform, Code Studio, for which 10 percent of all K-8 students in the United States have created accounts to learn the basics of computing. In Code Studio courses, 43 percent of students are girls and 37 percent are black or Hispanic. Code.org’s course sequence, starting with Code Studio in the early grades, and continuing through Exploring Computer Science and AP Computer Science Principles courses in high school, will teach students how to create their own technology and apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Before leaving high school, &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; student deserves the opportunity to learn computer science and understand how it can help them lead in any career, regardless of whether they want to be software engineers or not,” said co-founder and CEO of Code.org Hadi Partovi. “Code.org is excited to work with the College Board to extend this opportunity to students of all backgrounds and inspire more underrepresented students, especially women, to pursue bright futures using computer science.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board and Code.org will co-fund the expansion of computer science and professional development of new computer science teachers in schools and districts that commit to using the PSAT 8/9 equitably to identify students who have potential for success in computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collaboration between these two organizations also includes research on student learning and coordinated efforts to support policy changes that support access to computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the College Board expects to announce in the coming weeks and months additional resources and supports for AP Computer Science Principles from a range of organizations. All such programs will be communicated to secondary schools across the United States in fall 2015 to ensure that educators are aware of an array of options as they prepare to implement this new AP course in fall 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College Board and Code.org Announce Comprehensive Effort to Expand Diversity in Computer Science&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
