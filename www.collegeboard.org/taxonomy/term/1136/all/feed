The trip, which ends this week, is being filmed for a one-hour documentary that will air on PBS in spring 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “First-Gen Roadtrip” was a five-week adventure during which “Roadtrippers” conducted in-depth interviews with leaders who overcame obstacles and achieved college and career success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By speaking with leaders to learn how they got to where they are today, young students and job seekers alike are able to gain rare insight,” said Mike Marriner, cofounder of Roadtrip Nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vision for this project dovetails with the College Board’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/guidance/access-to-opportunity&quot;&gt;Access to Opportunity&lt;/a&gt; ™ (A2O&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;) program, which works to break down the barriers faced by low-income, first-generation, and underrepresented students and help them take advantage of the opportunities they have earned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Partnering with Roadtrip Nation on this unique and powerful project will give viewers a chance to hear directly from students about a topic that is relevant to so many others across the country,” said Steve Colón, vice president of Access to Opportunity.  “This work, combined with the College Board’s ongoing initiatives, can make a real difference in driving measurable outcomes for students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the Roadtrippers: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jasmine Johnson:&lt;/strong&gt; Jasmine is a sophomore at the University of South Carolina. Her family struggled to get by while she was growing up in North Carolina, and her tight-knit relationship with her family has sometimes prevented her from leaving her comfort zone. However, this has not stopped her from being the first in her family to pursue a college degree. “This road trip will allow me to take the first step outside my ‘Carolina bubble’ by giving me the nudge I know I need,” said Jasmine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenny Rogers:&lt;/strong&gt; Jenny is a first-year student at Mississippi State University (MSU). Since her mother passed away and her father was incarcerated, she has had to fend for herself and is putting herself through college. Although she is enjoying her time at MSU, she has struggled with gaining the confidence to decide on a major. ‘I hope that this trip will allow me to gain confidence in myself,’ Jenny said, ‘as well as meet people who struggled with and overcame the same lack of self-confidence that I feel.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Felipe Hernandez: &lt;/strong&gt;Felipe is a 24-year-old college graduate who plans to use his education to help low-income communities like the one he grew up in. He is a self-proclaimed natural-born leader who hopes to continue to travel and find adventure in his life. “I hope that this road trip will provide me with wisdom, guidance, and mentorship from leaders who have taken the journey I’m about to embark on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jonathan: &lt;/strong&gt;Jonathan is a sophomore at the University of Central Florida. Despite growing up in an impoverished single-parent household, he is pursuing his lifelong dream of getting a college degree. Although he fears failure at times, he hopes that this trip will expose him to others who have succeeded in the face of similar adversity. “I am really excited about the opportunity to speak with influential leaders who can help me become the leader I know I could be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advice from an Unexpected Place&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to their scheduled interviews, the road-trippers had the unexpected opportunity to talk with Alejandra Ceja, Executive Director of the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics, and U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Be authentic in what you do because once you do, people will listen and be more willing to follow,&quot; Ceja told the road-trippers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secretary Duncan sat down with the students inside the trademark Roadtrip Nation RV to share his advice on passion and success with the students: &quot;Try and figure out over time what you would do every day because you love to do it. Yes, you need to make a living, that&#039;s important. You need to pay the bills. But I&#039;ve done two things in my life. I played basketball for a couple years and the rest of my life I&#039;ve worked in education, and those are my two passions. There have been times when I&#039;ve made a lot of money and times when I&#039;ve made very little money and quite honestly it didn&#039;t matter to me because I&#039;ve always done what I loved. I feel so lucky to have done that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Roadtrip Nation and the College Board Team Up for First-Gen Road Trip&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;line-height:1.42857143&quot;&gt;Jasmine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.42857143&quot;&gt; Just being here in Vegas. It’s incredible. It means a lot to me to even be invited; to know that people want to see me, meet me, and hear my story. I’m also happy to see my Roadtrip Nation people – our trip in the RV ended a couple of months ago, so it’s like a little reunion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;line-height:1.42857143&quot;&gt;Jenny:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.42857143&quot;&gt; Seeing how much people really want to hear from us and are listening to our experiences and suggestions for how to support first-generation students.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;line-height:1.42857143&quot;&gt;What Forum experiences will you take back home with you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;line-height:1.42857143&quot;&gt;Jasmine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.42857143&quot;&gt; I’m studying to become a teacher, so I am a total education nerd! I’ve been going to lots of sessions, listening, learning, and meeting new people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;line-height:1.42857143&quot;&gt;What was the best part about your Roadtrip Nation journey?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;line-height:1.42857143&quot;&gt;Jenny:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.42857143&quot;&gt; This might sound cheesy, but it really was getting the opportunity to interview so many amazing people. After we interviewed Nikki Cooley from Fifth World Discoveries I was exhilarated. I thought maybe gaining knowledge from so many successful first-generation people would feel like a burden but it wasn’t – it was weightless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;line-height:1.42857143&quot;&gt;If you could share one message with other first-generation students who want to go to college, what would it be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;line-height:1.42857143&quot;&gt;Jasmine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.42857143&quot;&gt; Understand what’s stacked against you, but know that being a first-generation student isn’t your identity; it doesn’t label you. Each individual has the opportunity to be amazing and the potential to learn; you have the right to define your own road in life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.42857143&quot;&gt;And to the teachers and other educators: don’t be negative. Be the motivation we need. Embody that positive energy and momentum and demand it of those around you. Create a positive environment that allows first-generation students to grow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;line-height:1.42857143&quot;&gt;If you could pass along one message to College Board and its members about how to better serve first-generation students, what would it be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;line-height:1.42857143&quot;&gt;Jenny:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.42857143&quot;&gt; It’s frustrating to work the system. Counselors especially need to be trained and have equal knowledge about the process – particularly the financial aid process – so kids don’t get bounced around between so many people in one office. I can’t tell you how many times I left a financial aid office crying because nobody knew how to help me. So they’d just pass me along to another colleague who they thought could help, but inevitably couldn’t.  But the last counselor I saw really got it. She was clear, supportive, and really took care of me. She told me what to do, what she was going to do to help me, and that we’d find the solution. That meant the world. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                                                         &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Overheard at Forum: Jasmine Johnson and Jenny Rogers from Roadtrip Nation&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The documentary follows the students on a five-week long national journey during which they have the opportunity to visit with successful professionals from different sectors who were first-generation college students themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/RTN%204.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height:281px; width:500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edna Karr was selected to host the pre-screening of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz_Xm2VD7Is&quot;&gt;“Why Not Us?”&lt;/a&gt; because of their commitment to prioritizing academic success and their work to break down the barriers faced by many of their students. In 2013, Edna Karr was one of only three high schools to receive the College Board’s Inspiration Award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the screening, College Board’s Vice President of Access to Opportunity &lt;span&gt;Steve Colón&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and Roadtrip Nation’s Jason Manion participated in a panel discussion with the “roadtrippers” and answered questions from Edna Karr’s students. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The bright green 40-foot Roadtrip Nation RV was parked outside of the school and several students had the opportunity to go inside the RV that housed the students during their roadtrip. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/RTN%203.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height:309px; width:500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentary will premier on PBS on April 29, 2015. After the premier, the film will be be available for viewing through the College Board’s website and Roadtrip Nation’s online video library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roadtrip Nation and the College Board aim to empower and inspire first-generation students to attend and complete college, and pursue a career reflective of their interests by connecting them with first-generation leaders who were able to overcome obstacles and achieve success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Why Not Us: First-Generation College Students&amp;#039; Documentary Screened to Over 900 Students in New Orleans&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;How would you define success? What’s one piece of advice that you live by? Where were you when you were our age? These are just some of the questions our first generation road trippers asked successful professionals who were also the first in their family to graduate from college. Hear their answers and more in Roadtrip Nation and the College Board’s “Why Not Us?” documentary airing on PBS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Why Not Us?

&lt;p&gt;The new tool, which will be available with the release of PSAT-related assessment scores this December, will be more than your average career aptitude test. Tied to a student’s interests and passions, the roadmap to careers will be personalized and informed by the things that “light them up at their core.” Students will be able explore candid video interviews with successful professionals from all walks of life—individuals who seek to inspire by sharing how they pushed through obstacles and achieved their goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Career exploration can help solve real problems for students—it can motivate college readiness, help them understand which pre-requisite courses they need to take, and open their eyes to new possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Aaron Lemon-Strauss, Executive Director of SAT Student Success at the College Board, told the educators in the room: “This tool will get more data into your hands so you can have better conversations with your students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, it’s available at no cost to students who take the PSAT™ 8/9, PSAT/NMSQT®, or the SAT®.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for more information on the College Board&#039;s and Roadtrip Nation’s “Roadmap to Careers” tool later this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;First Look at “Roadmap to Careers” Tool at Forum&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
