&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Access: Let’s start with the basics. What is “prior-prior year” and why is everyone talking about it right now? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anne &lt;/strong&gt; :   &lt;a href=&quot;https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/fafsa-changes-17-18.pdf&quot;&gt; President Obama recently announced &lt;/a&gt; that beginning in October 2016 for the 2017-18 academic year, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) will be available earlier —in October, rather than January — and  the FAFSA will now use tax information from two years ago (prior-prior year) — as opposed to last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connie: &lt;/strong&gt; Here at the College Board, we’re excited about the many potential benefits for students, including being able to file the FAFSA and get federal aid eligibility information earlier, and the likelihood that more students will complete the FAFSA. At the same time, we believe that this change will have big impacts on higher ed and counselors, and on both the admission and financial aid processes, and so it’s important for our higher ed members to begin engaging and planning as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Access: What should higher ed be preparing for? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connie: &lt;/strong&gt; The earlier financial aid application timeline has the potential to affect admission and financial aid deadlines and notifications, as well as student outreach and recruitment activities. In the longer term, PPY will allow counselors and access organizations more time to advise students about college affordability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anne: &lt;/strong&gt; For financial aid professionals, the implementation of PPY will affect many things — including policies, operations, and systems. While we hope that PPY will reduce the federal verification burden for both students and aid offices, Pell and state grant allocations might not initially align with earlier awarding timelines. In addition, institutions could receive more appeals from students whose incomes change significantly from year to year. Aid offices are great at dealing with change, and these are the kinds of impacts they’ll need to consider and manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Access: How should higher ed start preparing? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connie: &lt;/strong&gt; First, we recommend that higher ed leaders start planning &lt;strong&gt; now &lt;/strong&gt; , so they are ready to make decisions and begin rolling out changes in communications &lt;strong&gt; early in calendar year 2016 &lt;/strong&gt; . We’ve spoken with a number of members who have already started this work, and based on those conversations, we have the following recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get up to speed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/fafsa-changes-17-18.pdf&quot;&gt; the change &lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chronicle.com/article/How-Fafsa-s-New-Reliance-on/233701&quot;&gt; its impacts &lt;/a&gt; as quickly as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Form a strong partnership with admission/enrollment and financial aid to assess and analyze impacts, educate campus stakeholders, and make recommendations and decisions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Initiate and/or continue conversations with key campus stakeholders and decision makers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide input to the College Board on key issues and support needs. You can email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:preppingforppy@collegeboard.org&quot;&gt; preppingforppy@collegeboard.org &lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Access: So what’s next for the College Board and its members? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anne: &lt;/strong&gt; The College Board is in a unique position to understand and support this shift because our members are focused on all aspects of the high school-to-college transition. We’re really looking forward to working with all of our members to listen, provide support, and help ensure that students are able to benefit from this shift. We encourage everyone to join the conversation and participate in our upcoming assembly meetings that will take place at the College Board Forum, Nov. 4–6 in Washington, D.C. Or, if you aren’t attending the Forum, we encourage you to email us with issues and ideas at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:preppingforppy@collegeboard.org&quot;&gt; preppingforppy@collegeboard.org &lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The College Scholarship Service Assembly will meet on Thursday, Nov. 5 from 2:45 to 4 p.m. ET, and the Guidance and Admission Assembly will meet on Thursday, Nov. 5 from 4:15 to 5:30 p.m. ET. &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.collegeboard.org/registration&quot;&gt; Register &lt;/a&gt; online for the Forum.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connie: &lt;/strong&gt; We’re very optimistic about the benefits that PPY will bring for students, and we’re committed to helping support higher ed, counselors, students, and their families and tackling this broad-reaching shift together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Anne and Connie! And remember — members can continue to find updated information right here on &lt;em&gt; All Access &lt;/em&gt; as this process moves forward.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reflecting on the Stories behind Financial Aid at NASFAA Annual Conference</title>

&lt;p&gt;Before unpacking this lofty statement, I should mention that I did not expect to walk away from the recent NASFAA national conference feeling…emotional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expected to learn about federal loan policy, prior-prior year implementation, and more about how colleges are using College Board services like PROFILE and PowerFAIDS—and I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I also realized pretty quickly as I spoke with financial aid practitioners from across the country that behind the off-putting terminology of their profession are people helping people; people who have stories to tell about how their financial aid awards literally changed their lives. These stories are as inspiring and as impactful as any tale of improbable success. They are the stories of Tabitha McCallister, who worked full time making less than minimum wage and caring for three children while obtaining a master’s degree; of College Board’s own Amber Briggs, who overcame homelessness and verbal abuse to become the “caring adult” that invests in other students’ lives; and Janet and Ramon Murguia, whose immigrant parents may not have made it past the seventh grade but understood the importance of education, and pushed each of their six children to obtain multiple advanced degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These panelists would likely argue that the financial aid professionals who changed their lives are opening doors to the American Dream. “I was approached by at least a dozen financial aid professionals after I got off stage, who all expressed their gratitude to me for sharing my story, saying that they were glad to be reminded why they do what they do,” Amber said to me after the session. “Since I have helped students obtain financial aid in my previous work as a college access counselor, I felt lucky that I could share their enthusiasm for their work—everyone is so clearly focused on positively impacting students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as Uncle Ben once said to Peter Parker, with great power comes great responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People get very emotional about money, and applying for college is one of the first big decisions that a young person makes in their life,” said Pamela Mason, Director of Financial Aid Administration at Columbia University in New York City. The prospect of paying for college can depress the enthusiasm of even the most motivated student. Part of the job of a financial aid advisor, she explained, is to interpret the jargon while maintaining the dignity of the stressed-out students and their families. “We are literally guides through the jungle—we hack away at the vines and leaves that threaten to block their path to help students get to college,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tabitha shared a similar sentiment while on stage: “He empowered me,” she said of the financial aid director who made her education a reality. “He made sure I understood my financial circumstances. He made sure I knew how to fill out the FAFSA by myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no secret that there are mounting pressures on students and families when it comes to paying for college. As the cost of college continues to rise, many sessions focused on how to simplify the financial aid process to allow for easier access to the funding available for loans, grants, and scholarships. Several policy recommendations were brought forward during the NASFAA conference that would build on the implementation of prior-prior year and an earlier FAFSA, such as changing the Pell Grant system so that students can rely on receiving a grant without going through the application process year after year; having students fill out a form that indicates their low-income status only once throughout their college career; and reducing the number of questions on the FAFSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether any of these changes will make a material difference will be determined over time. The stories, though: those had an immediate impact on how I view the wild world of financial aid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Reflecting on the Stories behind Financial Aid at NASFAA Annual Conference&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
