Because many of my Advanced Placement Program&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; students are African American and Hispanic/Latino and because I have achieved success both in enrollment and achievement, I am honored to share some of the techniques and programs that have been effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our district, any child who is identified by the College Board as having &lt;a href=&quot;https://appotential.collegeboard.org/app/welcome.do&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“AP potential”&lt;/a&gt; is automatically placed in AP classes. Although this is an easy way of increasing enrollment and certainly has increased the number of minority students in our AP classes, unfortunately some of the students feel they are being forced to take classes. I believe there are more effective ways of encouraging the desire for excellence that involve not only rigor but also fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective tools for encouraging a climate of academia within our district was implementing AP Vertical Teams&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;. I served as Team Leader for the AP Vertical Team for English. When we operated with a team approach, we saw immediate and significant growth in our program. English teachers in grades 6–12 met monthly, and we set up and conducted our own workshops during the summer. We also participated as a group at several College Board–sponsored &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/prof-dev/workshops&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;workshops&lt;/a&gt;. Working together gave us a common language, a common purpose, and a shared vision of how to navigate our curriculum to truly reflect the movement from Pre-AP&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; to AP. We became invested in the students who we collectively identified as early as sixth grade and then followed their progress right through graduation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To encourage community involvement in our AP program, our Vertical Team held AP Saturday sessions. These fun and educational workshops were open to students (and their parents) identified as having AP potential. These Saturday sessions were always well attended and included the ever-popular pizza party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the most successful ways of encouraging minority students to participate in our program was the launch of “TEAM AP.” We held a T-shirt design contest that challenged students to develop a T-shirt that would rival the team-spirit shirts our school athletes wear before their games. The winning design was developed incorporated into the Team AP shirt that TEAM AP members wore every Friday. We handed out T-shirts to all potential AP students and their teachers from grades 6 to 12, which enhanced our homegrown version of academic team building. Even kids who had no interest in AP were very interested in how they could “get one of those shirts.” I currently teach students who still have the shirt that they received in sixth grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I made it a point to attend every professional development opportunity offered by College Board. The Summer Institutes and my attendance at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apac.collegeboard.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AP Annual Conference&lt;/a&gt; significantly changed and shaped the way I approach recruitment and the way I teach the course itself. Probably the professional highlight of my entire teaching career was being selected to &lt;a href=&quot;https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/professional-development/become-an-ap-reader&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;score&lt;/a&gt; the AP English Language and Composition Exam. It is impossible to put into words how significant and invaluable that experience was for me as an educator. Suffice it to say it is something I would encourage all AP teachers to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;

What he saw concerned him. In his part of the state — a predominantly rural region where the median household income is less than the national average — there was a striking lack of AP depth and success. Building on his previous experience as a K–12 district superintendent, Gilchrist galvanized neighboring district leaders and began to build an AP movement in northeastern North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the leadership of Gilchrist and College Board’s Jenny Krugman, vice president of strategic advocacy and outreach, ECSU, and the College Board regional team put together the ECSU Plan of Action for Advanced Placement and jointly provided resources to host several convenings and professional development sessions for teachers, administrators, AP Coordinators, and other stakeholders. Their ultimate goal focuses not only on expanding access to AP for students in the region but also on informing all stakeholders, including parents, teachers, school officials, city government officials, and business leaders, that expanding AP is an investment in the economic stability of region as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spring 2013, the team conducted a five-hour “advanced academics for all students” session for superintendents and their staff from over 20 local districts. During the session, College Board staff shared the philosophy behind AP, including the challenges and benefits for students and their families, and provided in-depth information on AP Potential™ and PSAT/NMSQT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;. Following this session, the district leaders invited their teachers and curriculum coordinators to attend a one-and-a-half-day convening on ECSU’s campus later that summer. ECSU provided housing, food, recreation, and meeting space. The College Board developed sessions and AP resources tailored specifically for this group. Except for travel, participants attended this comprehensive workshop free of cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the workshop, regional College Board staff continue to hold webinars and conduct direct communication with participants to provide updates, hone-in on specific areas of interest, and discuss next steps. 2013 AP participation data will be used as a baseline to track AP participation and score results through 2016 to measure the success of the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ncpta.org/index.php/2013/07/22/nc-budget-education-highlights/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;North Carolina AP Partnership&lt;/a&gt; — an effort to build a pervasive culture of AP throughout the state — takes shape, the work of the northeastern region will be transitioned into this larger effort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College Board Trustee Leads Local Push to Expand AP® in Northeastern North Carolina&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The president joined distinguished guests, including NBA All-Star Chris Paul, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, and Deputy Secretary of Education Jim Shelton, to discuss the opportunities and persistent challenges that face young men of color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board, one of several organizations that have pledged their support for this initiative, was recognized for its &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/k-12/all-in&quot;&gt;“All In” campaign&lt;/a&gt;, which works to ensure that African American, Latino, and Native American students have access to the Advanced Placement Program&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (AP&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;) and other rigorous academic opportunities. Three AP student representatives who exemplify how such access can lead to lifelong learning and success were invited to participate in a town hall session with President Obama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derrick Simmons&lt;/strong&gt;, a recent graduate of Howard University with a degree in mathematics, is working on his teaching degree from American University and will begin student teaching at Dunbar High School in Washington this fall. He took eight AP Exams in high school and was one of the very few African American males in the country to receive an AP Scholar with Honor distinction from the College Board.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julius Figueroa &lt;/strong&gt;graduated from West Leyden High School just outside of Chicago and plans to major in philosophy at Columbia University this fall. He took six AP courses in high school, often speaks about learning for learning’s sake, and created a self-directed independent study to read important philosophy texts. In addition to participating in the town hall, Julius was featured on a panel along with the CEO of AT&amp;amp;T and a superintendent representing the Council of the Great City Schools, where they discussed linking education to workforce training and future employment.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luis Jose Hernandez &lt;/strong&gt;cites his AP Environmental Science class as his most impactful academic experience, and he will study science at Fordham University this fall. Luis was raised in the South Bronx by Dominican immigrant parents who did not attend college but who pushed him to excel in school to escape poverty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Brother’s Keeper is part of the new Presidential Task Force to Expand Opportunity. According to the White House, “The president believes this includes ensuring access to basic health [and] nutrition and to high-quality early education to get these kids reading and ready for school at the youngest age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board is solidifying its partnership with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cgcs.org/&quot;&gt;Council of the Great City Schools&lt;/a&gt; to dramatically increase the proportion of African American, Latino, and Native American students with AP potential who are enrolled in AP classes. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Going ‘All In’ for Our Nation’s Students of Color</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the last 10 years, the College Board’s Advanced Placement expansion efforts have nearly doubled the number of students who have been given access to the opportunities AP repeatedly proves to offer, including greater college preparedness and potential cost and time-savings through credit-granting policies. We are especially proud that low-income students have made up a significant part of that growth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we still have a long way to go. The PSAT/NMSQT® is currently the best indicator of a student’s potential to succeed in certain AP courses. But last year alone there were nearly 300,000 students with this potential who didn’t take an AP course for which they were qualified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap between earning the opportunity and seizing it is most pronounced among traditionally underserved minority populations. For example, only 3 out of 10 African-American students with high potential for success in AP science course work take an AP science course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One essential approach is to continue to bring AP into schools with these academically prepared and motivated students, particularly those with large minority and low-income student populations. To that end, we have developed partnerships with the Michael &amp;amp; Susan Dell Foundation to launch &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/initiatives/ap-opportunity-program&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(255, 120, 0);&quot;&gt;150 new AP courses &lt;/a&gt;reaching more than 9,000 low-income students in the next three years, and with Google and DonorsChoose.org to create 500 new &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/initiatives/ap-stem-access-program&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(255, 120, 0);&quot;&gt;AP STEM&lt;/a&gt; courses in public schools and enable more women and minorities to excel in science and math. The latter project enabled 10,000 students who did not previously have access to AP courses to take AP exams this past May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ironically, our greatest challenge may be to get more qualified students into AP classes in schools where AP already exists. A shocking two-thirds of students with AP potential who do not take AP classes attend schools that do in fact offer AP in their curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons are complex and manifold, but one thing is clear. According to public opinion research, the most powerful factor that turns a potential AP student into a registered AP student is the spirited encouragement and enthusiastic support of a teacher, counselor, or school administrator. In other words, adults who work in schools have enormous influence and can, by reaching out to a student with AP potential and encouraging her or him to take AP classes, quite literally change the education trajectory of that student. In schools with high percentages of underrepresented students, the cumulative impact can be incalculable. That’s why we started “&lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/k-12/all-in&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(255, 120, 0);&quot;&gt;All In&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All In is a College Board campaign that aims to unite educators, administrators, communities, and students themselves in an effort to ensure that every African-American, Latino, and Native American student with AP potential enrolls in at least one AP class and that every ounce of talent is given the chance to blossom instead of wither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In creating All In, we have been inspired by the hundreds of schools and districts that have already made enormous progress by supporting teacher professional development, removing financial barriers, aligning curriculum and instruction, and so much more. And we honor those that have made a concerted effort to identify and recruit students with AP potential, like last year’s Advanced Placement Large District of the Year winner, Texas’s North East Independent School District. Sheila Richards, one of its AP English teachers, describes the overall approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of our goals is to find students who might not otherwise participate in the program and to bring them in and assure them that we, the adults, are there to help them. We’re the support system and we’re going to use all the tools in the toolbox to make sure that they find success; (we tell the students) yes, it’s difficult, and, yes, you’ll be challenged, but we’re going to be there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invite you to be there for students as well by visiting our &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/k-12/all-in&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(255, 120, 0);&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, joining the All In campaign, and helping us get &lt;em&gt;every single qualified student&lt;/em&gt; into those AP classrooms. We want all in. No exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want all in because we believe that access to opportunity is as inalienable a right as the pursuit of happiness. And for a large portion of our nation’s youth, AP is what gives them a running start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s what led West Leyden High School Class of ’14 graduate Julius Figueroa to speak on a distinguished White House panel last week to discuss how AP paved the way for his acceptance to Columbia University this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s what inspired Derrick Simmons, who just graduated from Howard University, to go on to pursue a graduate teaching degree at American University while teaching math to low-income minority students in a Washington, D.C., high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s what has made—and continues to make—opportunity and success realities for countless thousands of students. But until these realities are in the vision and reach of every student—regardless of race, background, or family income—our satisfaction with what we have accomplished must be tempered by our obligation to do more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We share that obligation with the educators, counselors, and administrators at the literal doorsteps of our nation’s youth. We hope that, by joining All In, you will open those doors with the materials, knowledge, and strategies that will help every one of your students step confidently into the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Going ‘All In’ for Our Nation’s Students of Color&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The young men — all successful AP&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Exam takers from the Washington, D.C., metro area — were there to share their experiences and insights with administration officials charged with overseeing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/my-brothers-keeper&quot;&gt;My Brother’s Keeper initiative&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The young men were remarkably thoughtful, well-spoken, honest, and often funny in recounting their stories. The stories they told reflected the full range of the American experience, touching on immigration, financial hardship, economically secure two-parent households, grave family illness, high-wealth suburban schools, and under-resourced city schools. The administration officials — all men of color themselves — engaged respectfully with the young men and shared their own backgrounds. And, if they were listening carefully, the officials heard the same themes that the All In program has identified through public opinion research: the critical role that adults who work in schools play in shaping students’ expectations for and of themselves; and the isolation that is often felt by high-achieving students of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maghan, in his opening remarks and throughout the two-hour meeting, deftly and repeatedly struck the “own your future” chord. Then he took it further, challenging the young men to not only own their own future but also embrace the responsibility of truly being their brother’s keeper. Being their brother’s keeper means reaching out to high-ability peers and encouraging them to take rigorous courses, and providing lowerclassmen with support. The young men responded to Maghan’s challenge, calling themselves “agents of my brother’s keeper,” and looked to the College Board to help them find ways to serve other young African American, Latino, and Native American men. We’ll keep you posted on how well we do in meeting their expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meeting was held in the Indian Treaty room of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building — a room sheathed in marble with a soaring ceiling — widely thought to be one of the grandest rooms in the White House complex. After the meeting, the young men viewed ever-grander and more historic rooms as they enjoyed a private tour of the White House. Some who lagged behind even caught a glimpse of Bo, the Obama family’s dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a day the young men will likely remember for a long time. Perhaps even more important, the officials who attended the meeting seem to have found it valuable — valuable enough that as the College Board group departed, there was talk of holding similar meetings in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following young men attended the October 27 meeting:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adrian Ernesto Jiminez&lt;/strong&gt;, Loudoun County High School&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Patrick Cuyjet&lt;/strong&gt;, W.T. Woodson High School&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reese Falcon Fulgenzi&lt;/strong&gt;, Loudoun County High School&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas Elliott Stone&lt;/strong&gt;, United States Naval Academy (previously from Mount Hebron High School)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phillip Dean Hilliard&lt;/strong&gt;, River Hill High School&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soulihe Jemal Nida&lt;/strong&gt;, University of Maryland (previously from Wheaton High School)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Randall Theophilus Crandon&lt;/strong&gt;, River Hill High School&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Francis Adebayo Oyebanjo&lt;/strong&gt;, Gwynn Park High School&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norman Morris Ellis III&lt;/strong&gt;, Woodbridge Senior High School&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kireh Terrell Wright&lt;/strong&gt;, Parkville High School&lt;/p&gt;

I teach in a low-income, urban school about five miles north of Boston. About 80% of my students receive free or reduced lunch, meaning they live at or below the poverty level, and many are English language learners. In the past few years, enrollment has dropped off significantly in AP Literature for a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possible reason is that my school operates on a four period block schedule, and students are limited in the number of AP classes they can take. Perhaps the largest factor is the strong drive for students to enroll in STEM courses. That, coupled with the economic and governmental push for students to enter STEM fields, has resulted in an increased number of students taking AP math and science courses. Further, there exists a mistaken notion that &quot;you only take AP Lit if you want to be an English teacher.&quot; Students don&#039;t seem to understand the value of taking AP Literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I believe that the significance of taking STEM courses in today&#039;s world is enormous, I also firmly believe that a strong foundation in the humanities will serve students well no matter what field they enter. The ability to read and write well is essential to any career. In fact, I&#039;d argue that a course like Advanced Placement Literature and Composition is one of the most important classes a student can take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, I needed to communicate this to my students. I wanted them to find a balance in their lives that would truly make them college and career ready. I decided the best way to share this information was through the words of my former students. So I took to Facebook and emailed my former students, who were now working in successful careers that ran the gamut from biochemical engineer to market research analyst. I asked these former students to articulate the value of a course like Advanced Placement Literature and Composition, and this is what some of them said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hina&lt;/strong&gt; is now an attending physician and clinical instructor. She attended Wellesley College, where she majored in Biological Chemistry and minored in Religion. She went on to Cornell School of Medicine. Hina stated, &quot;&lt;em&gt;AP English was one of my favorite high school courses. Today I work as an emergency room doctor. Taking AP English has made me well-rounded and has fostered an appreciation of the humanities that is critical to a full intellectual life. I feel I am a better doctor - and a fuller person - as a result of taking AP English.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morris&lt;/strong&gt;, now an Asset Manager, received his B.S. in Communications from Boston College. &quot;&lt;em&gt;Of all the high school classes I took, the skills I gained from AP English were of the most use to me after high school, through college, and for my career,” he stated. “Critically digesting information, formulating original opinions, and expressing those thoughts clearly and concisely, are all invaluable everyday life skills.  Not to mention, being able to think on my feet has saved my tail countless times during executive meetings!&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rob&lt;/strong&gt; is a Lead Systems Engineer at General Electric. He received his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute and his MBA from Quinnipiac. Rob told me, &quot;&lt;em&gt;I was reluctant to at first to take AP Literature because I knew I was going on to pursue a career in science. Few classes and teachers have challenged me intellectually the same way I was challenged that year. AP Lit forced me to think analytically and critically. These are the cornerstones of problem solving, and they form the foundation for a career in science. The class helped increase my proficiency in writing exponentially, giving me an inherent advantage over my peers that exists to this day. Whereas most math and science students lacked a solid background in writing, I had ample experience. With increasing competition for jobs in the business world, the ability to effectively and coherently communicate thoughts and ideas is a differentiator, regardless of the field you pursue.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a sampling of the wonderful replies I received. I gathered about twenty of the responses, typed them up, and printed them out with photos of each former student. I then mounted them on poster board, laminated them, and created a &quot;Why Take AP Literature and Composition&quot; bulletin board right outside my room. Every time I see a student reading the responses, I have to smile. I also created a booklet which featured each former student&#039;s story, and I distributed it to parents and prospective students on AP Information Night. And I brought Rob in to speak to the families, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AP Lit numbers jumped from 16 students last year to 32 students this year. I am fairly certain the powerful words of former RHS students compelled some of these new students to see the value in taking the course. As we endeavor to increase enrollment and provide equity and access for all in our AP courses, the voices of our former students can be strong motivators, which reflect the value of exploring rigorous curriculum in high school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Former AP® Student Voices = Increased AP Numbers&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Assistant Principal Bill Krammes, who also serves as a member of the College Board’s Midwestern Regional Council, talked to the Blotter about the benefits of AP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to provide an environment for our kids where they can reach for their fullest potential and understand what that potential is going to be. Without that AP experience, a lot of our kids don’t really know how much they can do,” Krammes said in the article.&lt;/p&gt;

I am really not that out of touch with the wonders of technology, I just get busy working with the kids and forget about all the new things that could really make my life — and especially my teaching life — better. So, here goes … my first blog — whatever that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I live in Salt Lake City and teach at East High School, which has, over the years, changed demographically from an upper-middle class, fairly universally white school to an inner-city school with a population of 2,000 students, 62 percent of whom are students of color (mostly Hispanic) and about 55 percent of whom qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. I have been teaching for 39 years in three public schools and one private school in Salt Lake City. Originally, I went to East High to teach in the at-risk program, but the principal knew (as does everybody in Salt Lake City) that for the majority of my career, dating back to 1985 or ‘86, I taught AP United States History. So when the AP teacher retired earlier than expected — in midyear, no less — guess who, in January of 2013, became the AP U.S. History teacher?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I inherited two sections of AP U.S. History, with about 40 kids in each class (don’t gasp, this is Utah, where we “stack ‘em deep, and teach ‘em cheap”). There were about eight students of color in both AP classes combined. As a school, we had been talking about how to get our minority students to participate in AP, but frankly, it was mostly lip service. So, as a person of color,  I decided that the enrollment in AP U.S. History for the 2013-14 school year had to be exactly like that of our school — 62 percent students of color.  I only kind of knew what I had gotten myself into; the enrollment was actually the easy part. First, I asked for a list of all the students in 10th-grade World History, about 425 students. Next, I sent letters to the students and their parents explaining what AP is and why the students should take my course. Then, I identified the minority students and met with them individually, explaining why they needed to take AP U.S. History. If students were reluctant to sign up for the course, I made phone calls and home visits to the parents, registration cards in hand. What I learned was that many of the students had heard of AP, but believed that it was “too hard” for them. Many told me flat out that AP was “only for white kids.” In reality, most were afraid of failing and had incorporated what they had heard from other students into their self-image.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, the new school year started, with 185 students enrolled in AP U.S. History, 30 percent of them students of color; not the goal, but a significant improvement. Then, the real work started. I found that students didn’t read well or enough, so I used a number of strategies from the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vertical Teams Guide for Social Studies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In addition, I used the strategies from the old “Building Success” workshop, renamed “Strategies for Social Studies and Language Arts Teachers.” Specifically, I used the Levels of Questions strategy as a place to start. Next, we used the SOAPS strategy. One of the first assignments was to read “The Strange Death of Silas Deane” from a collection called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;After the Fact.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; This article helps students to understand that history isn’t just the past, it’s how historians view and write &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; the past, and how they make selections about what should be included in history books. Next, we read a primary source (the police report) about the shooting of Trayvon Martin. I asked students if they thought that justice was served in the George Zimmerman trial. Once students got into the primary sources — studying conflicting sources, offering their inferences and opinions, and collaboratively discussing the evidence — they were hooked.  From that point in the school year, the intellectual spark was lit, and we worked like we were on fire. I never focused much attention on taking the AP Exam — I didn’t want to create negative energy or stress. More than anything, the minority students in particular needed to believe in themselves — that they could actually do the work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A friend of mine who is a professional photographer took pictures of every student, and under the headings “I Am Smart,” “I Am Talented,” and “I Can Achieve,” we placed 8 x 10 glossy color prints of each student. We called it the Wall of Fame.  Were they prepared for AP? No. Was much of the work they did of AP quality? Eventually. My goal was to set the bar higher but not too high; like teaching kids to ride a bicycle, I raised the training wheels a bit every month. Every paper they wrote could be rewritten for a higher grade.  We worked on critical reading skills, outlining, Cornell notes, and conceptual identifications. I held after-school seminars for one hour every Wednesday and Thursday, offering extra credit (a concept I hate) if kids would come. By October, I was working 80 hours per week, so I enlisted the help of my university students (I teach history part time at the University of Utah) to help score papers and tutor kids during class and after school. I awarded good grades for effort more than content, encouraging students to rewrite. I used lots of primary documents, real historical dilemmas, funny YouTube videos, and lots of positive encouragement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the course of the school year, only one student had dropped the class. In May, 80 of my students took the AP Exam. I don’t know how they did — but that isn’t exactly the point. The goal was to build self-esteem and confidence; to help the students realize that college-level work is more about commitment and effort than about being smart or, for that matter, white. For some, just completing the course was a victory; for others, taking the test was a victory. Some may actually earn scores of 3 or above.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next year, there will be 205 students — about 35 percent of whom are students of color —enrolled in AP U.S. History at my school going through essentially the same process as this past year but with the help of Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) teachers, who are trained in helping underachieving students with high academic potential to succeed. What I’ve learned from this experience is that first, students must develop confidence in their abilities; second, they need constant positive encouragement. Teachers need to be ready and willing to work with students of all academic levels, and to be ready to implement individual strategies and assignments as needed.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I reflect on this school year, I am so exhausted that I can hardly believe that in about eight short weeks, I will be at it again, with a completely new energy and with a new AP U.S. History course to implement. At least, I hope I will have new energy — &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; energy would be welcomed at this point, but thankfully that’s why we have the summer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Teacher Talk: Reflections on AP® Participation from Salt Lake City, UT &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
