It has been an important part of the college admission process for millions of students since its introduction in 1926, and it remains an important part of that process today. As the former head of undergraduate admission at Stanford University, Occidental College, and Vassar College, I’ve seen firsthand how SAT scores and high school grades combine to become a strong predictor of first-year college success. And soon, the SAT will have an even stronger connection to the work that students are doing in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning next spring, students who take the SAT will see a new version of the test. Before redesigning the test, the College Board looked at the research that shows what skills and knowledge students need to know to be ready for college and career. We also listened to feedback from students, parents, teachers, and college and university professionals. The result is a test that is more useful, focused, and clear than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the changes that students taking the test in March 2016 and anytime thereafter should be aware of include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Content that is better aligned to what they’re already learning in class. Now there’s a clearer connection between what students are learning in school and the skills and knowledge we’re assessing on the SAT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A focus on the areas of math that research has shown to be most important for college success. For example, proportions and algebraic linear equations will be on the test; logic puzzles that have little connection to the math students are learning in class will not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A focus on vocabulary that students are likely to use again in college and career. Two words students won’t see on the test: “prevaricator” and “sagacious.” They may see a word like “synthesis,” however, which is used often in the contexts of chemistry, philosophy, biology, and psychiatry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No penalty for guessing. Students will earn points for the questions they get right — but won’t have points subtracted if they choose the wrong answer. There are also fewer answer options for multiple-choice questions — four, instead of five — so students making an educated guess are more likely to choose the correct answer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The College Board wants every student to have an equal opportunity to practice for the redesigned SAT, regardless of their financial situation. That’s why we’ve teamed up with Khan Academy®, a leader in online education, to provide all students with high-quality, personalized SAT practice absolutely free. This partnership will level the playing field by providing official SAT study tools to all students who want them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official SAT Practice — which launched in early June — is an interactive experience that identifies the areas individual students need to work on based on how they answer short quizzes and official SAT sample questions. It then tailors a study plan for each student and provides instant feedback so students can know how they’re doing and be proud of the progress they’re making. Of course, the best way to practice for the new SAT is to take challenging courses in high school and work hard in those courses. Official SAT Practice is intended to reinforce the great work already being done in class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer is a time to relax, read for pleasure, and recharge. It’s also a great time for students to explore Official SAT Practice. We look forward to seeing these students — and all students who follow — benefit from the changes we’ve made to the SAT and succeed in college, career, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of his keynote at the National College Access Network conference, College Board&#039;s president David Coleman announced today the launch of a new free SAT practice smartphone application: &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/practice/daily-practice-app&quot;&gt;“Daily Practice for the New SAT”.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daily Practice for the New SAT is now available for iOS and will be available for Android within two weeks. It includes some relatively standard stuff that SAT readiness apps do:  there’s a question of the day for the new SAT that students can work on to stay fresh.  We’ve innovated here, providing a way for students to batch download questions so that they don’t have to complete questions in drips. The questions themselves are also much higher quality than you’d get on a similar app from another provider, but fundamentally this is still business as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the Daily Practice app blazes ahead is with the Scan + Score feature.  For the first time in test prep history, students will now be able to take a picture of their answer sheet and receive scores instantly. Beyond just the scores, they’ll also be able to see their performance on each question with detailed answer explanations. The results will be linked to students’ individual College Board accounts,  so they  can link their College Board and Khan Academy accounts (available in December) to receive  personalized instructional recommendations based on the practice test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen percent of low-income households rely on a smartphone for their sole source of internet access.  Daily Practice for the New SAT will take technology’s promise of personalization and marry it with the tried and true accessibility of paper-and-pencil testing.  With free practice tests available for download or from their counselor’s office, now &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; students can benefit from the personalization that technology provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, as David Coleman said, “The Daily Practice for the New SAT app is a remarkable tool. Students are empowered to own their learning; all they need is a pencil, paper and a cell phone. We are delighted to unveil this tool at NCAN together with leaders of college access organizations who work each day to propel students into opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new app is already available to download &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/daily-practice-for-the-new-sat/id1033927734?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. A step-by-step user guide to Daily Practice for the New SAT is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/practice/daily-practice-app&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, which can also be reviewed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/practice/daily-practice-app&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; on our website.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Students can get SAT Practice Scores Instantly on their Smartphone with New App &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Read the original &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/collegeboard/2015/11/19/current-sat-vs-new-sat-which-should-i-take/&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2015-16 school year is a unique one for the SAT because students in the class of 2017 — today’s juniors — have the option of taking two different versions of the exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current SAT will be administered on Dec. 5, 2015, and for the last time on Jan. 23, 2016.  The &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat&quot;&gt;new SAT&lt;/a&gt; — which has been redesigned to focus on the few things that matter most for college and career readiness and to better reflect what students are learning in class — will be administered for the first time on March 5, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As students decide which test to take, here is some important information to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:0.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both tests:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will be accepted by most U.S. colleges and universities for the next few years;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have been carefully researched to make sure they’re fair and valid for all students;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have free, full-length practice tests available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;KhanAcademy.org&lt;/a&gt;; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;May be taken with &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/register/fees/fee-waivers&quot;&gt;SAT fee waivers&lt;/a&gt; (by eligible students).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:0.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only the new SAT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comes with free, personalized practice tools and study recommendations at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;KhanAcademy.org&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Has &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/practice/daily-practice-app&quot;&gt;an app&lt;/a&gt; that lets students take a photo of their completed practice test answer sheets with their phone and instantly receive their scores ­­— in addition to offering sample questions and answer explanations;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Has an &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/inside-the-test/essay&quot;&gt;optional essay&lt;/a&gt; (the essay on the current SAT is required); and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does not penalize students for guessing incorrectly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Students can learn more about the differences between the tests — including exam length, time per question, and the specific skills that will be tested — by visiting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/inside-the-test/compare-old-new-specifications&quot;&gt;College Board website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s juniors should feel confident taking the new SAT this spring because it better reflects what students are learning in class and its subject matter will be more familiar. More good news: Students who took the PSAT/NMSQT in October will have an excellent idea of what to expect on the new SAT because the tests share the same format and measure the same skills and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage any student who is having a hard time deciding between the two versions of the SAT to take both. Late registration is still available for the Dec. 5 test, and registration is open for both the last administration of the current exam in January and the first administration of the new exam in March. Before taking either SAT, students should check the admission policies of schools to which they’re interested in applying to make sure they have the latest application information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whichever SAT they choose, students can rest easy in the knowledge that they’re taking an important step on the road to success in college, career, and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Current SAT vs. New SAT: Which Should I Take?&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Read the original release &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-college-board-elegizes-anachronistic-verbiage-with-recondite-panegyric-celebrates-final-administration-of-the-extant-sat-on-jan-23-300209046.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;NEW YORK&lt;/span&gt; -- Throughout its 100-year history, the abstruse vocabulary words of the SAT&lt;span&gt;® &lt;/span&gt;have engendered prodigious vexation in millions of examinees annually. On &lt;span&gt;Saturday, Jan. 23&lt;/span&gt;, students across the country participated in the terminal transpiration of the SAT in its habituated gestalt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To adumbrate the changes to be manifest in future administrations of the assessment: The new SAT will be more trenchant and pellucid, and the format will no longer pertinaciously reward students who punctiliously engage in the antediluvian praxis of committing idiosyncratic words to memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College Board President &lt;span&gt;David Coleman&lt;/span&gt; promulgated, &quot;Your invectives and maledictions have been heard. Clemency has been granted.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many within the College Board and the academic community expressed a paucity of maudlin or mawkish emotion in response to the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a new beginning for the SAT. Gone are obscure vocabulary words and tricky logic questions that are disconnected from the work students do every day,&quot; said &lt;span&gt;Stacy Caldwell&lt;/span&gt;, vice president of the SAT Program at the College Board. &quot;Moving forward, students will encounter a test that focuses on the few things that matter most for college, work, and life. We believe these changes will benefit students and educators alike.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The redesigned SAT will debut on &lt;span&gt;March 5, 2016&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;The College Board Elegizes Anachronistic Verbiage with Recondite Panegyric; Celebrates Final Administration of the Extant SAT® on Jan. 23&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;As SAT enters a new era this week, students say the exam has improved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/people/nick-anderson&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(46, 109, 157); font-family: FranklinITCProBold, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nick Anderson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-normal modal-0 horizontal-photo&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; border-top-width: 0px; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: FranklinITCProLight, HelveticaNeue, &#039;Helvetica Neue Light&#039;, &#039;Helvetica Neue&#039;, Helvetica, Arial, &#039;Lucida Grande&#039;, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;courtesy-of-the-resizer zoom-in&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_908w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/03/01/Others/Images/2016-02-29/COLLEGEBOARD_Paskova_0041456793468.jpg&amp;amp;w=1484&quot; style=&quot;cursor:-webkit-zoom-in; width:619px&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;College Board President David Coleman at his office in Manhattan.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK — The SAT’s infamous guessing penalty is gone. Its vocabulary is less arcane, minus words like “lachrymose” and “obsequious” that students tended to memorize and then forget. Its essay is now optional. The perfect score — set in 2005 at 2400 — is reverting to the iconic standard from generations past: 1600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most important change to the retooled college admission test that debuts this week for hundreds of thousands of students nationwide lies in its approach to what they learn in high school. The new version of the SAT aims more than ever to measure core skills taught in school, such as reading charts, analyzing evidence and applying algebra in mathematical problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board, which owns the 90-year-old test, sought to purge the tricky questions — akin to brain teasers — that were vestiges of what used to be called a “scholastic aptitude” measurement. The theory behind aptitude testing was to find innate potential in students regardless of where they went to school. Now the SAT is officially described as an achievement test meant to reward those who study hard in class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It most resembles the work that kids are already doing in the classroom,” College Board President David Coleman said this week in in an interview with The Washington Post at his office here in New York. “I think the old SAT was a departure from kids’ everyday work, in their schoolwork. Evidently. It was almost universally felt to be so.”&lt;/p&gt;

(Family photo)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo Barrillon and Jordana Graveley, juniors at Conard High School in West Hartford, Conn., called the revision an improvement. They took the SAT on Wednesday during school along with 40,000 other 11th-graders in Connecticut, with testing fees fully paid by the state. Both also had taken the old version in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I noticed that in the reading, there were a lot more ‘evidence-based’ questions,” said Barrillon, 16. “You would have to find a source from the text to support your answer to the previous question. That was definitely different.” Barrillon said he believed the new test reflected his studies more than the old one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo-right modal-2&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; margin: 0.5em 0px 10px 20px; padding: 0px; float: right; clear: right; max-width: 100%; border: 0px none; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: FranklinITCProLight, HelveticaNeue, &#039;Helvetica Neue Light&#039;, &#039;Helvetica Neue&#039;, Helvetica, Arial, &#039;Lucida Grande&#039;, sans-serif; width: 150px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;66401f335d&quot; id=&quot;66401f335d&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Jordana Graveley (family photo)&quot; class=&quot;zoom-in&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2016/03/graveley-150x150.jpg&quot; style=&quot;cursor:-webkit-zoom-in; max-width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jordana Graveley. (Family photo)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a lot more focused on what we have learned in school,” Gravely, also 16, agreed. One of the reading passages, she said, was a document that covered material familiar from history lessons. “The vocab was really actually something that you would encounter in real life,” she said. The old SAT penalized students for incorrect answers, to deter guessing. But the new SAT eliminates that rule. “It’s a lot less of learning how to take the test than the old one was,” Graveley said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new SAT also was rolled out Wednesday in schools in the District of Columbia, New Hampshire, selected New York City schools, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Jose, and in Florida’s Hillsborough and Seminole counties. On Saturday morning, 277,000 students from across the country are scheduled to sit for the test. In all, 463,000 students are expected to take the new SAT this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruce Reed, a test-preparation consultant in California, said student perceptions about the new SAT matter less, in the end, than whether the test yields reliable and valid results to help admissions officers do their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Isn’t it ultimately about the colleges?” he said. “It’s a hollow victory if it’s just a test that feels better when you’re taking it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revision has been years in the making. Coleman, one of the architects of the Common Core State Standards, was given a mandate to rethink the admission test when he took the helm of the College Board in 2012. The Common Core spells out what students should learn in math and English language arts from kindergarten through high school. Those standards, and the assessments connected to them, were widely adopted but have proven politically controversial. The College Board considered Coleman’s expertise an asset as the nonprofit organization grappled with discontent about its marquee test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-normal horizontal-photo modal-3&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: FranklinITCProLight, HelveticaNeue, &#039;Helvetica Neue Light&#039;, &#039;Helvetica Neue&#039;, Helvetica, Arial, &#039;Lucida Grande&#039;, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;ce49200722&quot; id=&quot;ce49200722&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;courtesy-of-the-resizer zoom-in&quot; src=&quot;https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_908w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/03/01/Others/Images/2016-02-29/COLLEGEBOARD_Paskova_0091456793470.jpg&amp;amp;w=1484&quot; style=&quot;cursor:-webkit-zoom-in; width:619px&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;A screen in the lobby of the office of College Board president David Coleman, in Manhattan, on Feb. 29.

&lt;p&gt;The last overhaul of the SAT, in 2005, added a writing section with a required 25-minute essay, worth a maximum of 800 points, to the math and critical reading sections, also worth up to 800 points each. In ensuing years, the SAT lost market share to the rival ACT admission test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACT, based in Iowa, assesses English, reading, math and science, with an optional essay. It has long been perceived as a straightforward achievement test, with slightly higher time pressure per question than the SAT. It does not have a guessing penalty, and it has never purported to measure aptitude. Colleges now accept either test equally, and in 2012, the ACT surpassed the SAT in usage. In the nation’s Class of 2015, about 1.9 million students took the ACT, compared to 1.7 million who took the SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/12/24/the-sat-now-the-no-2-college-test-pushes-to-reclaim-supremacy/&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(46, 109, 157); border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(212, 212, 212); zoom: 1;&quot;&gt;The SAT, now the No. 2 college test, pushes to reclaim supremacy&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One cannot ignore we’re in competition with the ACT,” Coleman acknowledged. But he said that was not the main driver of the SAT changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman unveiled his vision for the new SAT in March 2014. He wanted a transparent test, stripped of trickery and grounded firmly in what students learn. He also announced that the College Board would team with the nonprofit Khan Academy to offer students free online tutorials for the SAT, a measure aiming to reduce the advantage of families wealthy enough to hire private test-preparation consultants. Since June, 900,000 students have registered with Khan for SAT practice and have completed 39 million problems, Coleman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old SAT took 3 hours and 45 minutes. The new version is 3 hours, plus another 50 minutes for those who opt to write an essay. The two core sections are math and “evidence-based reading and writing.” Most of the questions are multiple-choice, but some math questions require students to write in an answer. The math section focuses on algebra, data analysis and fluency with complex equations and expressions in preparation for advanced math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculators, previously allowed throughout the math section, are now barred from certain portions of the new test. There also is less emphasis on geometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/college-board-releases-preview-of-new-sat-exam-questions/2014/04/15/d59f2f9c-c4a1-11e3-bcec-b71ee10e9bc3_story.html&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(46, 109, 157); border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(212, 212, 212); zoom: 1;&quot;&gt;College Board releases preview of new SAT exam questions&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some prominent universities in recent years — including Wake Forest and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/07/27/george-washington-university-applicants-no-longer-need-to-take-admissions-tests/&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(46, 109, 157); border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(212, 212, 212); zoom: 1;&quot;&gt;George Washington — have dropped requirements&lt;/a&gt;for applicants to submit SAT or ACT scores. Critics of the tests say that they are a needless barrier to college access for disadvantaged students, and that transcripts and other information can tell colleges all they need to know about an applicant’s academic potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the large majority of selective colleges, in the Ivy League and beyond, continue to require submission of scores. They will be watching closely how the revised SAT performs its mission of helping to predict college success. That could take years to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re quite optimistic that it will be at least as good as the old test,” said William R. Fitzsimmons, longtime dean of admissions and financial aid at Harvard University. “But we have to wait and see.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitzsimmons predicted that many students will cheer getting rid of flash-card vocabulary — “words that appear only once in your lifetime, but really have no connection to what you encounter in college or after college.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah Quinlan, dean of undergraduate admissions at Yale, said getting ready for college should never be about tricks or last-minute cramming for a test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I believe that the redesigned SAT is on the right path in its transparency and openness, and that it sends the clear signal that if you work hard and achieve, we in higher education will work to open doors for you,” Quinlan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbara Jenkins, superintendent of schools in Orange County, Fla., which serves tens of thousands of students from low-income families, said she is “most excited” about changes to the SAT that suggest its payoffs are not reserved only for the elite or for those who can afford a prep course. The message, she said, is that practice pays off for anybody. “There’s not some anointing that you’re ‘smart’ or ‘not smart,&#039;” Jenkins said. “Instead, it’s something you work toward to open opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education is replete with inequities, from preschool through college, with students from affluent backgrounds enjoying far more educational resources; there are strong correlations between standardized test scores and family income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman said he is mindful that those inequities are stubborn. But he said the SAT’s revision, coupled with the Khan Academy initiative, gives the College Board a strong reply to critics who say that privilege can purchase an edge in opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You say ‘SAT’ and people say, ‘Well what about the test prep?&#039;” Coleman said. He said that many people wonder “how can a challenge be fair if the tools of practice are costly, and if there’s a sense of mystery and that some people can sell you the secrets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step to reform was clear, he said: “I had to get rid of the secrets.”&lt;/p&gt;

It is vital to students and our members that we correct this misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Roorda falsely claims that the College Board derived our new concordance tables based on the March 2016 administrations of the new SAT. In fact, we conducted two large-scale national concordance studies in December 2014 and December 2015. This approach exceeds industry standards. We stand behind the methodology and the results of these studies, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/educators/higher-ed/scoring-changes/concordance&quot;&gt;concordance tables&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/scores/understanding-scores/sat-score-converter&quot;&gt;SAT Score Converter app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted these concordance studies before the first administrations of the new SAT because we clearly heard from our members at colleges and universities across the country that they would need this information to make admissions decisions this year. Additionally, states and districts that have recently switched from administering the ACT to administering the SAT statewide need concordance information to maintain continuity of students’ historical data within their student information systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Roorda goes on to question the process we used to develop what is known as a derived concordance between the ACT and the new SAT (Mr. Roorda refers to this as a “chained concordance”). Several months ago, we reached out to ACT to express our strong interest in conducting a new SAT-ACT concordance study to update the existing decade-old study. In the interim, however, a derived concordance is a valid way to provide our members with the information they need. We want to assure our members that the derived concordance between the new SAT and the ACT is technically sound.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to working with ACT in a renewed spirit of cooperation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Information about New SAT Concordance &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Students also complete a questionnaire, which include a series of optional questions. For instance, students can provide their race or ethnicity, and by doing so, help the College Board evaluate the fairness of the test and ensure that it is fair and accurate for all students. By sharing their course preference and potential college major, counselors and college admission officers can help students make plans for the future. Students can indicate if they come from a military family in order to be connected to unique information and resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we make clear to students, they don’t have to respond to these and other optional questions, but we recommend they do because it helps us and our members best deliver programs and opportunities to serve students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are in constant dialogue with students, parents, educators, and state and district partners in order to evaluate our policies and procedures. As a result of this engagement, we regularly enhance student privacy. For example, just recently, we announced:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will no longer collect Social Security numbers from students who participate in our assessment and instruction programs. (Effective August 2018)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The question about religious preference or affiliation on the questionnaire will change from &quot;Indicate your religious preference or affiliation&quot; to &quot;Are you interested in religious colleges or religiously affiliated campus clubs/activities? If yes, select a religion below.&quot; (Effective August 2017)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The College Board has a deep respect for student privacy, and we are committed to protecting it. We are a signatory, with more than 200 K-12 school service providers and education leaders, of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://studentprivacypledge.org/privacy-pledge/&quot;&gt;Pledge to Safeguard Student Privacy&lt;/a&gt;, a public commitment for the responsible collection and use of student data. You can learn more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/privacy-policy&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, including about the principles that ensure our commitment to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, here are answers to some questions we frequently receive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Does the College Board sell student data? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The College Board does not sell student data. Through Student Search Service, students may participate in a voluntary program that connects students with information about educational and financial aid opportunities from nearly 1700 colleges, universities, scholarship programs and educational organizations. When students take the SAT, PSAT/NMSQT and PSAT 10, they are asked if they want to participate.  By opting in, they give the College Board permission to share their name and limited information with college and scholarship programs looking for students like them. The College Board never shares social security number, actual test scores, self-reported parental income, disabilities, or phone numbers as part of Student Search Service. Participation is completely voluntary and students can opt out at any time. Eligible institutions sign a license agreement with the College Board, and the College Board consistently monitors their use of student information for compliance. After a five year term, the institutions must permanently destroy the data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Does the College Board make unsolicited phone calls or send unsolicited texts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not send students text messages or emails or call them on the phone unless they specifically opt in to the communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Our Commitment to Student Data Privacy&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
