&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Panel on Student Opportunity is made up of diverse high school and college student representatives from across the U.S. Members must make a three-year commitment to the panel, and be willing to speak and travel independently, attend annual conferences, and provide the College Board with a student voice. Each year, about 80 applications are received for three new spots on the panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re here to remind you that you’re doing this for the students,” panel member Liliana Esquivel said as Tuesday’s session opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students reiterated their passion for the work of the College Board and Forum attendees, noting the passionate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/counseling-admissions-financial-aid-academic/sal-khan-opens-college-board&quot;&gt;opening plenary from Sal Khan&lt;/a&gt; as a highlight of the conference so far. The hour long conversation with audience members brought to light several themes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive outlook on the redesigned SAT: &lt;/strong&gt;Students expressed optimism about the redesigned SAT, debuting in spring 2016. “The exam will serve as a means of demonstrating prowess and academic accomplishment, rather than as a test that you need to cram for and find all the tricky manipulative ways to do well on,” said panel member Will Larsen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to resources and Information throughout the College Application Process: &lt;/strong&gt;members highlighted programs in their schools that provide support and resources to students as they navigate the college application process. Examples included hosting a panel of alumni in their first year of college, and “Application Fridays” where students bring in their applications to work with counselors and teachers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenging coursework is for everyone: &lt;/strong&gt;students argued that programs that put students in categories early on in high school make it harder for students to elevate themselves out of that track. “It’s really important for kids to get the sense that they can succeed in Advanced Placement (AP) no matter what their previous classes were,” said panel member Jack Seigenthaler. “It needs to be a message of opportunity rather than a message of selectivity.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early engagement can support diversity in advanced coursework: &lt;/strong&gt;panel members suggested connecting with middle school students and their families and translating materials into several languages as ways to encourage diverse students to take AP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the students reiterated their passion for the work of the Advisory Panel on Student Opportunity and its role within the College Board as the organization works toward its mission of delivering opportunity to all students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Advisory Panel on Student Opportunity Shares Views on Access to Education, Rigorous Coursework&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

In a panel discussion with Vice President of Membership Barbara Cronan, the students talked about the support they’ve received in their quest for learning, as well as the obstacles they’ve had to overcome along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, the encouragement of family was crucial to the success of these students. “My family supports me in everything I do,” said Natural Baptiste, a student at the Brooklyn School for Math and Research in New York and member of the New York City Urban Ambassadors. “They’re 100 percent sure I’m gonna get the job done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy Tiblier, a first-year student at Wellesley College and chair of the College Board’s Advisory Panel on Student Opportunity, echoed this sentiment: “I feel supported by my family. My parents have really dedicated their professional lives to let me go to the college of my choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family members aren’t the only ones who make a difference. “My AP Coordinator, Mr. Hidalgo…was so passionate and made class so engaging,” said Maria Velasco, a senior at Arroyo High School in San Bernardino, Calif. — one of this year’s Gaston Caperton Opportunity Award winners. “He taught me the point of school is to learn,” rather than to get high GPAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But learning can sometimes take a backseat to major life stressors. “Cancer was a huge obstacle,” said Jacob Lockhart, a senior at Idaho’s Coeur d’Alene High School — another of this year’s Opportunity Award winners. But with the support of his family, his community, and his doctor, Jacob was motivated to take (and excel in) AP Chemistry. “I love AP so much,” said Jacob, “I’m taking four more this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural’s obstacle was homelessness. “I was evicted with my mother and twin brother,” he said. “At 10, you think everything is easy. But … it’s not.” Natural said the experience motivated him to succeed: “Now that I overcame it, I feel like I can conquer anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep students engaged, Jacob advised educators to tailor their instruction to students’ aspirations and goals. “Make them feel like you’re taking the time to teach them something specific for themselves,” he said. “[Students] don’t want to be involved in something that doesn’t have anything to do with them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the discussion, the students asked the audience to remember that students are more than grades. “Numbers don’t tell the whole story,” Natural said. “You have to look at the student holistically.” This is something that students need to keep in mind, as well. “Remind students that their purpose is to learn and soak up as much as possible,” said Lucy. “That shouldn’t get lost in the pursuit of grades.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Students Talk; We Listen&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
