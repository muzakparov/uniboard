Last week at the Advanced Placement Annual Conference (APAC), I – along with the rest of the attendees at APAC – had the chance to hear directly from the College Board’s Advisory Panel on Student Opportunity (APSO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The APSO is a group of high school and college students who provide their perspective to the College Board on our programs and how we can work together to increase college and career readiness for students. The students attend College Board events and serve as representatives on our internal governance committees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At APAC, the APSO engaged in a conversation as part of their panel, “Student Response – A Dialogue with the Advisory Panel on Student Opportunity.” The students shared their experiences taking AP and other rigorous courses: highlights and lowlights, test-taking skills and study strategies, successes and failures. Here are some the things they had to say:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teachers are your greatest resources&lt;/strong&gt;: “My teacher was the biggest tool for getting a 5 on my AP exam,” said Anthony Salerno, a junior at Sarasota Military Academy. Engaging in group discussions, review sessions, and leveraging their teacher’s expertise were all highly encouraged by the students.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to (and knowledge of) prep materials helps: &lt;/strong&gt;Making practice materials and other supports available to students was reiterated by several of the students. Liliana Esquivel, a student at Ogelthorpe University, said that her high school had an AP room with a lounge area and materials for students to review and practice their skills. Just as important is making sure students are aware of what is available. “Not all students are aware of the different resources,” said Spenser Sullivan, a student at Arkansas State University.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online tools support learning:&lt;/strong&gt; “Use Crash Course and Khan Academy,” said Abraham Wordsworth, an incoming freshman at Tufts University. Students cited these tools as important to their learning: allowing them to review complex tools and assess their progress. Others noted the use of online Facebook groups to ask questions, share tips, and offer encouragement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hearing these words of wisdom from students helps those of us in education get a better sense of what’s working and what’s not. For me, it reinforces the reason I come to work every day: to improve the lives of these students and support them on their journey to college and car&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Advisory Panel on Student Opportunity Gives a Behind-the-Scenes look at taking AP Courses&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
