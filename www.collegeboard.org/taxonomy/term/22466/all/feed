Notestine was chosen out of five finalists and more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schoolcounselor.org/asca/media/asca/Press%20releases/SCOYsemifinalists.pdf&quot;&gt;35 semi-finalists&lt;/a&gt; as the recipient of this annual award, given to &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the best of the best – school counselors who are running a top-notch, comprehensive school counseling program at either the elementary, middle or high school level,&quot; according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schoolcounselor.org/school-counselors-members/awards&quot;&gt;program&#039;s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although the National Teacher of the Year has been honored by the president at the White House since that program started in 1952, this is the first time in its multiyear history that the National Counselor of the Year ceremony was held there. This is a welcome sign that the important work of school counselors, as part of Obama’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/reach-higher&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.42857143; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;Reach Higher Initiative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, will have a more prominent role in the administration’s approach to education reform. Lauri Benton and Lorraine Hastings represented the College Board at the ceremony.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/07/01/remarks-first-lady-american-school-counselor-association-annual-conferen&quot;&gt;Speaking at the ASCA Annual Conference&lt;/a&gt; in Orlando, Fla., this past July, Obama said that “school counseling is a necessity to ensure that all our young people get the education they need to succeed in today’s economy.” She also promised to bring the National Counselor of the Year ceremony to the White House — and on Friday afternoon that promise became a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School counselors are an important part of the educational leadership team. They provide valuable assistance to students regardless of whether they work in an elementary school, middle school, high school, or beyond. At the College Board, we work most often with secondary school counselors. These professional educators bring a mental health perspective to understanding and responding to the challenges faced by today’s diverse student population. Secondary school counselors do not work in isolation; rather, they are integral to the total educational program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, we honor school counselors around the country as a part of National School Counseling Week. Thank you, school counselors, for everything you do to advocate on behalf of your students.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2017 School Counselor of the Year Terri Tchorzynski on Trends and Advice for New Counselors</title>

Read her full interview below, and learn more about the American School Counselor Association&#039;s School Counselor of the Year Program &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schoolcounselor.org/school-counselors-members/school-counselor-of-the-year-award&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you decide to enter the counseling profession?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always knew I wanted to be a school counselor because of my passion to help and support others. I’ve been a high school counselor for seven years but when I think about who I am as a school counselor, it’s who I am in everyday life. When I arrive to the office in the morning I don’t just put on my school counselor hat. I’m that person all the time; as a coach, as a mom, as a wife, as an ally and as a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some emerging trends in college admission you’ve seen that you expect to have a lasting impact on the profession?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re noticing that college admission counselors appreciate the depth of knowledge and extracurricular involvement that students have attained. Students with resumes packed with tons of activities are not necessarily viewed as the best candidates. Admissions counselors want to see that students have taken a devout interest in select activities and nurtured their interests consistently. Also, students, especially first-generation students, are more than ever grasping the importance of college and other post-secondary opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a success story you remember from your work with students?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall working with a 9th grade student who had a lot of behavior and academic problems but was interested in enrolling at the career center. Throughout her 9th and 10th grade years we worked hard to help her improve her grades and behavior. As a result of her success, she was accepted as a student at Calhoun Area Career Center. She has since graduated and is now a student at Lansing Community College studying to be a collision repair specialist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What advice would you have for a first-year counselor in terms of managing a large student caseload, and working together with parents and school administrators?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage first-year counselors to understand and implement a comprehensive school counseling program that impacts ALL students’ academic, career, and social/emotional development. It’s also important for first-year as well as seasoned school counselors to drive their program and interventions based on student data - attendance, grades, behavior and achievement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;2017 School Counselor of the Year Terri Tchorzynski on Trends and Advice for New Counselors&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
