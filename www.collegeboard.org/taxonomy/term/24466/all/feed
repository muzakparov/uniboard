This installment of the “Senior Year Chronicles” summarizes Andrew Elwell’s conversations with Rhea from New Jersey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first impression of Rhea was her polite and respectful manner.  It reminded me of my southern upbringing, minus the &quot;yes, ma’am.&quot; As we talked,  it became obvious that she has a close relationship with her parents, who were key in helping her prepare for college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I first asked Rhea about college, she confidently rattled off her plans. She wanted to major in Information Science and International Affairs because of her interest in cyber security and counterterrorism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a kid, I grew up always being surrounded by the news,&quot; she told me. &quot;My parents are firm believers that you should have a proper understanding of current events so you can try to make a difference in the future. Whenever I would sit and read the paper with my parents, they would explain to me that sometimes bad things happen on a daily basis. Being constantly surrounded by these events every day inspired me to want to help people in my future career. I knew public service was what I wanted to do, but I never really knew what that meant for me. In middle school, I took an online forensics course through John&#039;s Hopkins University and immediately fell in love with it. This then inspired me to want to incorporate technology in my public service career. When I grew older I became fascinated with the stories of the FBI using technology to thwart a terror attack, and I decided I wanted to go into the field of counterterrorism to do exactly that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhea&#039;s parentswere very helpful in assisting her with college applications, having navigated the process before with her older sister. Her parents were also very supportive about the major and colleges she had chosen to apply to, and they accompanied her on visits to college campuses. By October, she had settled on George Washington University (GW) as her top choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of preparing for college applications, Rhea played tenor saxophone and was also a member of the Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), where she served as Vice President of Community Service. Each year the organizatoin hosts a large event called Project Hope; people from all over the county attend, and proceeds are donated to a specific charity chosen for the year. This year Rhea was in charge of selecting the charity and appointing club members to run different activities at the event.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While her goal was to attend GW, she decided not to apply early decision. She applied early action to a few schools, including Northeastern, Rutgers, Temple, Drexel, and University of Maryland, and regular decision to Boston University and University of Pennsylvania. She wants to have plenty of options should it not work out for her to attend GW.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Rhea finished her Common Application essay, she was able to easily apply to most of the schools on her list because they didn&#039;t require supplemental essays. While writing additional essays for the schools that required them was challenging—especially while she tried to balance application work with her school work—fortunately her older sister was available to help by providing feedback and editing the essays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to financial aid, Rhea&#039;s mother was a great help. Together, they completed the FAFSA and the CSS PROFILE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhea’s work with FBLA continued with an exciting opportunity to attend the FBLA National Leadership Conference. This was the first time she had been away from her family for an extended period of time. While it was a bit daunting, she said it was a very positive experience, and it gave her a taste of what it would be like to attend college. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the conference she and a fried had to create their own small business, including a 30-page business plan outlining all the aspects of the business and how to run it. At the end of the week, they presented this plan to a board of judges. It was hard work, but Rhea got a lot of satisfaction from it and enjoyed working with her friend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Rhea headed into the final stretch of senior year, she had anything but senioritis. In addition to taking four AP courses, she was gearing up for the Project Hope fundraiser, attending New Jersey’s Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) State Leadership Conference, and participating in the Relay for Life. She was also practicing for her band trip to Disney World in April, looking ahead to her senior trip to Dorney Park in Allentown, PA, and last but not least,  preparing for senior prom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Vice President of Community at FBLA, Rhea&#039;s main focus in the spring was on their Project Hope event. Originally, the event was going to support the March of Dimes, but the team ulitmately decided to go with a New Jersey-based charity called &lt;a href=&quot;http://abirthdaywish.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A Birthday Wish&lt;/a&gt; instead. This organization provides foster children with cards and gifts on their birthday to let them know they are special; they also work to raise awareness of the need for foster parents so more children can be placed in loving homes. Much of Rhea&#039;s time was spent on the public relations aspect of Project Hope, drawing attention to the event and getting sponsors.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But back to the college search: Rhea was accepted to all but one of the schools she applied to. While she may not have gotten in to Boston University, she did get into George Washington University—her top choice—as well as Rutgers University, Temple University, Drexel University, and the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhea was on the fence as she narrowed down her choice to two: Drexel University and GW. After a final visit to Drexel University at the end of April, Rhea was ready to make her final decision. In the end, while she was very familiar with Drexel (her sister has been enrolled there for the past five years), she felt like GW was best suited to what she was looking for in a college. This fall she will be headed to Washington, D.C. as a proud Colonial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though it was difficult balancing college applications with her school work and extracurricular activities, Rhea says she didn&#039;t feel overwhelmed by the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Besides writing the essays, applying to college was not as stressful as I expected,” she told me. “Prior to applying, I had done my research on which universities provided me with the specific curriculum I was looking for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process of applying for financial aid, however, was a bit of a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although I have an older sister who went through the entire college planning process, it still felt like a brand new experience to my parents. That was definitely the most challenging part,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late spring, following her participation in the NJ state FBLA conference, Rhea wrapped up her FBLA responsibilities for the year; she took part in competition and supported her friend in her campaign for state office.  And the Project Hope event she organized for her FBLA chapter was a resounding success—it raised more than $1,000 for A Birthday Wish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With AP Exams in May, Rhea spent most of her free time getting ready. She practiced with friends, and even listened to a podcast that her AP Statistics teacher created for each chapter of their textbook to help her and her classmates study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she’s anxious to step foot on campus in the fall—the result of all her hard work the last few years—Rhea knows she’s ready to tackle a new challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m super excited to live in a completely new city freshman year and study a major that I am so passionate about,” she said. “I’m a little nervous being so far away from home and meeting so many new people, but I’m confident that I will adjust just fine after a few weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Senior Year Chronicles: Rhea&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

This installment of the “Senior Year Chronicles” summarizes Desirée Beach&#039;s conversations with Logan from Virginia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genuine. Dedicated. Astute. Compassionate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atypical words to describe teenagers—but then again, there is &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; typical about Logan Love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From our initial discussion last year, it was evident our meet-and-greet was going to take longer than the arranged 30-minute video chat. Why? Because I was so intrigued by this young man who is making great strides to effect change. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as his last name implies, Logan, a then 17-year-old senior at Patriot High School in Gainesville, Virginia, is driven by his love of helping others. What is most impressive about his desire to help is his authentic, altruistic nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve always known I wanted to help people,” Logan enthusiastically told me, so it’s not the least bit surprising that he logged over 200 hours of community service. As an active member of Key Club International (the high school affiliate of Kiwanis International, an organization aimed at serving children worldwide), his volunteerism ranged from helping the nurses in the ER at a nearby hospital to tutoring 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; graders at a local elementary school on a weekly basis.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When not giving back to his community, Logan was extremely involved in making new students feel welcome at school. As a member of the Pioneer Ambassador Club, he and other members helped mentor all incoming students (freshmen through seniors) in a unique way: He, like the other club members, would send text messages and have lunch with these new students, all in effort to provide more opportunities for the newbies to make “more emotional connections with people” and ultimately create new friendships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Logan’s dedication to school is evident, he admitted the demands “can be overwhelming,” at times. It is, however, the support of his parents—coupled with his aspiration to be the first in his family to attend college—that helped him stay positive and motivated. “Family involvement is so crucial to laying the foundation for success,” he noted, so it’s no wonder why Logan credits his parents for being integral to his accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked further about his driving force to attend college, he was quick to acknowledge the downside of potentially not having a college degree—“having the degree gives [you] credibility,” but not having it “restricts you financially and also [prevents you] from having choices and opportunities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logan took his SATs twice (including the redesigned SAT that he found to be “so much better”), and he submitted his first college application to Florida State University (his top choice) in October; he then submitted four more in November. Ideally, he hoped to be part of Florida State’s combined BA/MA degree program, so he could earn degrees in Political Science and Public Policy (an interest sparked by his previous AP World History and AP U.S. History courses). And while he had made a list of other schools, both in- and out-of-state, at the end of the day, his decision would be incumbent upon where he would get the most scholarships and aid.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By December, with half of his senior year almost behind him and two college acceptances in-hand—including his previous top-choice of Florida State—Logan was feeling anything but senioritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His successes inside and outside of the classroom no doubt played a likely role in his early acceptances to Florida State University and Jacksonville University, and though Logan initially had his eyes set on FSU, a visit to American University in D.C. appeared to have put a wrench in his plan to end up in the warmth of the sunshine state after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, Logan applied for early action “for the ease of mind”— waiting, like some of his peers, until March was not an option. “It would bring on too much anxiety,” he said, and ultimately not allow him the flexibility to make a solid decision. Compared then to other students who hadn’t yet applied, he felt pretty at ease and confident about his applications. “My hard work in a way has paid off,” he said, but noted he was “less confident with having choices because of money.” Since funding for higher education was a chief concern, Logan decided early action would give his family enough time to plan things out as well as provide him with more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter American University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a campus visit, Logan was very enthusiastic about the school. “I liked the campus; it felt like a community, and [I’m very] interested.” Aside from the overall campus feel, American offers an Interdisciplinary Studies major that covers communication, economics, legal institutions, and government, all things about which he is “passionate and interested.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logan considered applying for Early Decision in an attempt increase his chances for admission, but if he were accepted the decision would have been binding. With Logan concerned about the financial implications of a binding early admission, he decided that in addition to applying to James Madison University, Georgia State University, and Flagler College, he would apply for regular decision with American University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Logan worked on his college applications, his dad busily tackled the FAFSA and the CSS PROFILE. Said Logan, “My dad likes to do the money stuff, so he completed it [FAFSA] in less than hour [and] didn’t seem to have a problem with it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Logan, the stress wasn’t so much about the applications themselves but more the financial strain his higher education might cause his parents. “The hardest part has been…[realizing] the cost of college and [knowing] how to pay for it. Everyone knows it’s expensive, but no one tells you how much.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After wrapping up his first semester, Logan found himself on the easier, “less stressful” end of senior year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By then he had received acceptances from Jacksonville University, Georgia State University, James Madison University, and Florida State University. What’s more, he was awarded $22K from Jacksonville and had his out-of-state tuition waived for Georgia State. With all of these options before him, his initial trepidation of being accepted to these schools was quickly replaced with the uncertainty and anxiety of making the right decision based on finances.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The money is just so daunting,” he said. For that reason, he felt that he would most likely decline JMU and American, even if he were accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Logan’s Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) club sponsor quelled his fears and assured him many individuals currently working for the Pentagon—a possible career goal for Logan—attended Florida State University. And, while he only received $1,000 and no scholarship or financial aid from Florida State University, Logan would be eligible for in-state tuition since his father had recently relocated to Florida for work and he and his mother would move soon after graduation. As a result, Florida State went back to the top of Logan’s college list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to scouring the Internet for scholarships, Logan was hard at work preparing for his AP US Government and AP Biology exams, and self-studied for AP Comparative Government because he thought, “Why not!”  And, since much curriculum review didn’t take place in the classroom, he depended on various study books and apps on his phone to stay on target. It wasn’t long before the importance of doing well on these exams shifted for Logan from “getting a good score because [he] thought it helped with college admissions” to understanding the impact of saving money by “seeing what courses [he] wouldn’t need to take at a university.”   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As graduation came closer, Logan was far from experiencing the ubiquitous senior feelings of confusion and alarm. With several college acceptances under his belt, he was riding high and was excited about the remainder of senior year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t all good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much to his (and my) dismay, though Logan was accepted to American University, his request for additional financial aid was denied. That left a typically upbeat and positive Logan feeling—and sounding—a bit dejected. “It’s frustrating, knowing that even though I accomplished a lot, it’s still not enough.”    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we talked through his frustrations, I reminded him of a tremendous accomplishment he was overlooking—he had been admitted to each of the six universities to which he applied, awarded scholarships from many, and admitted into various honors programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after the “pep-talk,” Logan’s somewhat despondent tone switched to excitement when he finally declared, “I’m going to FSU!” Logan believes everything happens for a reason, and that ultimately attending Florida State University will give him a greater chance to shine and make an impact.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked about what he is most excited and/or worried about for his upcoming freshman year, Logan expressed confidence and optimism that the transition will be an easy one and “nothing [he] can’t handle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on what we’ve seen of Logan Love thus far, I don’t think there is much this young man won’t be able to conquer!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Senior Year Chronicles: Logan&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

This installment of the “Senior Year Chronicles” summarizes Crystal Barrick&#039;s conversations with Morgan from Georgia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t remember &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;playing violin,” Morgan told me during our first conversation. She started when she was three years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But three years ago, shortly after moving to John’s Creek, Georgia, from Chicago, she almost quit. “I was bored of it,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, a serendipitous encounter with the John’s Creek High School orchestra teacher (and a quick glimpse of poster for the group’s upcoming trip to Italy) changed her mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan has since traveled quite a bit, and she is now president of the orchestra club. She helps organize the “Bigs and Littles” program, in which upper class students mentor their younger peers. “You don’t just learn about bass or cello,” she said. “You talk about your classes, teachers, and clubs, too. There’s a lot of travel and rehearsals, and a lot of bonding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the past year following Morgan’s senior year of high school as she navigated AP classes, college applications, prom, and plenty of other high school milestones. As a member of the College Board’s Youth Advisory Council, she was gracious enough to shed some light on the busy life of a current high school student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the orchestra club, Morgan’s other social center is the debate team. She stumbled upon the club at an activities fair her freshman year. The deciding factor? “I like to talk!” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researching for the debate team has “opened [her] eyes to the world” through real policy issues, like domestic surveillance and the history of the NSA, and it has also allowed her to travel. Through tournaments and camps, she’s had the opportunity to visit a slew of college campuses in- and out-of-state since her freshman year. When I asked whether this helped with her college search process, she said yes, but not in the way I expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Through social media, I’ve stayed connected to the friends I made,” she told me, and she’s called on them when she’s had questions about college social life, coursework, and faculty. “College websites can tell you anything,” she said, “but these students really know what it’s like.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan has a lot on her plate, but her voice rings with enthusiasm for the future, not stress. She took the SAT twice as a junior and feels good about her scores; she’s done extensive research on scholarships and financial aid; she’s found support in her AP class communities and clubs; and she’s kept herself organized through to-do lists and calendars.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By December of last year, Morgan had sent one batch of Early Action applications, but was waiting to hit &quot;submit&quot; on the rest until she heard from a few schools. Georgetown, Georgia Tech, University of Georgia, Harvard, University of Michigan, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Yale were in her sights; University of Georgia has accepted her, but she had her doubts about Harvard. &quot;I know it’s impossible to get into,&quot; she told me. &quot;Just had to see.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later she emailed me with good news: she got into Harvard. While their admissions office had told students they’d share their decisions by “mid-December,” the ever-updating chatter on College Confidential message boards eventually homed in on December 14. From morning to sunset that day, Morgan refreshed her email inbox and the school’s Facebook and Twitter feeds; a glitch that broke the online portal at 1:00 p.m. heightened her uncertainty. By 5:00 p.m., she said, she had to hole up in the bathroom of the local library where she was volunteering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I had to look in the mirror and tell myself it was going to be okay,” she told me. “I wasn’t freaking out, but I was on edge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, a congratulatory email sealed the deal. Lots of happy crying ensued, and—unsurprisingly to me, after our previous conversations—lots and lots of research. (Full confession: even I teared up when she recounted her story.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying for financial aid was a rockier experience, but Morgan was on top of it. &quot;I completed the FAFSA on October 2, the day after it o​pened, because I had this fear of missing out on financial aid opportunities,&quot; she said. She had some trouble with other parts of the process because she hadn’t heard of the CSS Profile or the IDOC until October, and she was surprised by how much documentation she had to provide. Her peers have been most helpful with this step—her dad went to college in Canada, her mom attended &quot;a smaller local school,&quot; and her school’s guidance department is &quot;fairly weak when it comes to the college application process,&quot; she shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While financial aid packages from  the schools she had been accepted to would play a big role in her college decision-making process, Morgan always had her heart set on Harvard. She fell in love after attending a Harvard-Yale football game last fall, and online sleuthing and conversations with current and admitted students solidified the feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked why the Big H was the right fit, she cited the unparalleled opportunities and resources she’ll have access to, starting her freshman year. While other schools seemed much more “siloed” and hands-off in their approach to business, economics, and public policy studies, Morgan told me, Harvard would let her combine her interests and develop her “think-on-your-feet skills.” The university has an undergraduate-run consulting firm that would not only allow her to travel, compete, and do research—things she’s grown to love through her high school debate team—but also support local nonprofits and startups in a meaningful, practical way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By spring, Morgan had officially made her decision to join Harvard’s class of 2021. While she’s looking forward to life in Cambridge, in the month’s leading up to move-in day she’s soaking up as much of her George life as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She attended her senior prom in a royal blue dress in lieu of visiting Boston for Harvard’s admitted students day. But, because it’s 2017, she wasn’t totally removed from the festivities—&quot;I still watched some of it on a livestream while getting ready,&quot; she admitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AP Exams were among Morgan&#039;s final academic commitments in May. To prepare for her AP Comparative Government, Macroeconomics, Statistics, Spanish, and Literature Exams, she had a few different &lt;a href=&quot;https://groupme.com/en-US/&quot;&gt;group.me&lt;/a&gt; chats going and some study sessions with friends and teachers. And, throughout the year, she kept meticulous outlines and notes. She seemed confident about her upcoming exams—compared to AP Bio and Calculus BC, which she took last year, she felt these wouldn’t require as much “out of school prep.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before graduation, Morgan otherwise kept busy with ceremonies, banquets, and parties. After a “dramatic Phantom of the Opera medley sendoff,” she gave a speech and received a yellow rose at her final orchestra concert; she then planned with her peers and some parent volunteers an end-of-year dinner for her fellow student-musicians. She most looked forward to the “senior carnival,” which fills the John’s Creek High football field with food trucks, games, and well-kept surprises each year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 16 Morgan will fly solo to Boston and then embark on a pre-orientation trip with other Harvard freshman. Though she’s very outdoors-y, she chose a service-oriented trip over hiking or kayaking because it will give her an opportunity to explore Cambridge and help out in her new neighborhood. Her parents will join her a week later for move-in day and orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked if she was nervous about anything, Morgan told me how much she was going to miss her 14-year-old brother. She was heartened by the sentiment that many people (including me) had shared, which is that they eventually felt closer to their siblings after spending some time apart. As a planner, she’s already come up with a strategy for staving off homesickness: a huge photo collage in her dorm room, featuring her brother, her parents, and her orchestra and debate team friends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Senior Year Chronicles: Morgan&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

This installment of the “Senior Year Chronicles” summarizes Sarah Leonard&#039;s conversations with Isabelle from Georgia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes of talking with Isabelle Riddle, a senior at Sequoyah High School in rural Canton, GA, it becomes clear she’s someone who recognizes the importance of balance in her life. Part of this may be due to her after-school life as a dancer (she does everything from pointe to hip-hop), but it also manifests itself in her academic attitude. Her favorite classes senior year were AP Calculus BC, Honors Anatomy, and Visual Art. Isabelle has always loved math, and anatomy is a natural choice given her desire to pursue a career in pediatrics. But art is something new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is my first year taking an artsy class, and I have enjoyed expanding my mind in that way,” she shared. “The class helps to relieve stress, and I am learning basic art skills that everyone should know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to taking a rigorous course load, Isabelle is a member of the College Board’s Youth Advisory Council, and she is involved in training her Labradoodle, Chloe, to be a therapy dog. “She’ll be able to go [to] libraries, hospitals, nursing homes. I’m hoping to take her into pediatric settings, [which would give] me some experience working in medical settings. I think it’s a great idea to combine dogs, which I love, children, and medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little over a month into her senior year, Isabelle was excited about the college application process. “It’s exciting to know that I will attend one of the schools I am applying to now in less than a year,” she said. (On her list: Duke, Emory, Georgia Tech, Harvard, University of Georgia, and Yale). “These senior year steps determine my life’s trajectory in a way, and it is cool—and a little scary—to be making those decisions right now.” However, this great excitement was also her greatest worry—particularly, finding the right college “fit.” “There are so many colleges with so many programs and so many factors to consider that I feel like I can’t make an informed decision about which school would be right for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, one thing Isabelle was less worried about was financial aid, thanks to her involvement with QuestBridge, a scholarship program for high-achieving, low-income students. QuestBridge hosts an annual conference focused on the college admissions process, teaching students about preparing a college application and financial aid processes. Isabelle participated in their College Match program, which grants application fee waivers and full scholarships to some of the most selective institutions in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through her involvement with the program, Isabelle realized that her diversity (she is Native American) is an asset “because I can bring a distinct perspective to a college campus.” She added, “QuestBridge also helped me realize that my income doesn’t have to hold me back. It is important for low-income Native students to understand that there are other options out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By December 2016, Isabelle had applied to four of six schools (Emory, Georgia Tech, University of Georgia, and Yale) and was in the process of finishing applications for Duke and Harvard. Excitingly, she had already been accepted to the University of Georgia and was awarded an academic scholarship!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The planning and research Isabelle put into her college search process could be a model for other students. “I tried to look at several factors when deciding on my college list,” she explained. “I tried to go for a good mix of schools—some close to home, some far away; some reach, some match, and some safety schools; some engineering/research, some liberal arts focused.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the application process was about what she expected, other aspects of college-going were more daunting. Isabelle was able to tour a couple of college campuses, visiting her sister at Harvard and attending a summer program at Yale. “I wish I could get to know every campus I’m applying to in this way!” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other thing she found challenging was the financial aid application process—in particular, juggling college applications with scholarship applications, FAFSA, and CSS PROFILE. While she received a QuestBridge scholarship for juniors in 2016, there was no guarantee that she would receive a scholarship in 2017, and even if she did, the amount awarded varies by institution. As a back-up plan, Isabelle applied to several national scholarships, including Jack Kent Cooke, Ronald McDonald, and Coca Cola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By February 2017, Isabelle had exciting news on both the admissions and scholarship fronts. She was accepted into Georgia Tech and Yale, bringing her college acceptances to three (she was previously accepted at the University of Georgia), and she had secured $1,000 from the Coca Cola Scholars Foundation. She was now one of 250 finalists vying for 150 $20,000 awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isabelle was eagerly waiting for April 1, when she would hear from four other institutions: Duke, Harvard, Princeton, and Vanderbilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, Isabelle thought fall of her senior year would be busy applying for college admission and scholarship awards. Spring, she figured, would be more relaxing. But as a semi-finalist or finalist for several scholarships, she was now entering interview season, and she had three interviews in February: one for Georgia Tech’s Presidential Scholar Program, one for the Coca Cola scholarship, and one for the University of Georgia Foundation Fellowship scholarship (the latter two in the same weekend!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was also busy preparing for AP Exams; she took five this year (Calculus BC, English Literature and Composition, Microeconomics, Physics C: Mechanics, and U.S. Government and Politics). While her teachers administered spring practice exams and after school review sessions, Isabelle was a little worried about retaining information from her fall-semester Microeconomics class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with all of these accomplishments, Isabelle was still a high school senior, which meant dealing with a mild case of senioritis. “I think mostly I’m starting to feel burnt out and tired of doing homework and studying,” she said, which was understandable given her rigorous course load and the extra demands of the college search and application process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a whirlwind spring, Isabelle finally had a chance to catch her breath and celebrate her remarkable achievements. One of those achievements was being accepted at all nine universities to which she applied: Duke, Emory, Georgia Tech, Harvard, MIT, Princeton, the University of Georgia, Vanderbilt, and Yale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really never expected to be able to say that [I got into all nine schools], but I am so happy it’s true!” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing among the nation’s top institutions is daunting, but Isabelle took a pragmatic approach and made a pro-con list, narrowing her choices to two: Harvard and the University of Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Both schools have positives and negatives, so the decision has been really tough even though I know they are both great options,” she reasoned. “Some of the biggest things I’m looking for in my college are pre-med advising programs, research opportunities, and a student body that is passionate about learning and doing whatever it is they like doing. I’m still trying to decide if I want to be far away from or near home, though.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, Isabelle’s pro and con list helped her make her decision. This fall, she’ll be a University of Georgia Bulldog. &quot;The travel, research, and individual mentoring opportunities were too much to pass up. I am looking forward to next year!&quot; she shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these stellar acceptances, Isabelle also amassed a tremendous amount of funding through scholarships and financial aid packages. She ended up winning one of the coveted $20,000 Coca Cola Scholarships, joining 149 other young people nationwide in earning this honor. However, because of the generous financial aid she received in the form of UGA&#039;s Foundation Fellowship, Isabelle plans to save the scholarship money for medical school. Perhaps the most important aspect of her financial aid awards, especially after all the hours she logged with applications and interviews, is that “no school was totally unreasonable” for her to attend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My family’s financial situation won’t hold me back from going wherever I want to college, which I think is how it should be,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking toward the future, Isabelle is excited to switch up her routine in college. “I think a new set of people and places will refresh me,” she said, adding that she’s also excited to start focusing on her primary area of interest, biology. Isabelle closed by saying, “I have really come to admire all that the College Board does through serving on the Youth Advisory Council, and I am so thankful for y’all.” After corresponding with her for the past several months, I’d say the feeling is mutual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Senior Year Chronicles: Isabelle&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
