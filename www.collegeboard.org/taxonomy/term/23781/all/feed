Read the press release below or on Achieving the Dream&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://achievingthedream.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Harper College president Ken Ender has served on the College Board&#039;s Board of Trustees since 2014. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atlanta, GA (February 23, 2016) – Achieving the Dream today announced Harper College in Palatine, Illinois, has won the eighth annual &lt;a href=&quot;http://achievingthedream.org/resources/initiatives/leah-meyer-austin-award&quot;&gt;Leah Meyer Austin Award&lt;/a&gt;, a national honor awarded to a community college that takes whole-college approaches to improving student success and achieves notable increases in student outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harper’s focus on transforming its culture and operations led to the following results during the period 2010 to 2014:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased graduation rate from 14 percent to 24 percent, according to the Integrated Postsecondary Data System (IPEDS)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved Hispanic/Latino students&#039; graduation rate from 11 percent to 25 percent&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased African-American students’ college-readiness in math rate from 15 percent to 58 percent&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raised Hispanic students’ college-readiness in math rate from 36 percent to 62 percent&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved African-American students’ completion rate for developmental math from 10 percent to 21 percent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Harper College worked across the college community with support from school superintendents, business and university leaders to increase student outcomes,” said Achieving the Dream President and CEO Dr. Karen A. Stout. “This is clearly realized by the marked improvement in graduation rates across all student demographics over the four-year period.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the award, the college will receive $25,000 to support its ongoing student success efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this year’s award winner, Harper is being honored for college-wide collaboration, culture change, and community engagement to improve student completion. Harper’s president, Dr. Kenneth Ender, and administrators, faculty and staff committed to creating a culture of cooperation and transparency, which dovetailed with operational changes that affected operations, resource allocation and related policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes also gave rise to a community-based strategic planning process. The 2010–2015 strategic plan established four key strategic directions - inspiration, partnership, accountability and completion - that have sustained comprehensive, college-wide momentum to advance student success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*For more information on the exemplary work of Harper College, &lt;a href=&quot;http://achievingthedream.org/resource/15105/2016-leah-meyer-austin-award-william-rainey-harper-college&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Leah Meyer Austin Award was established in 2008 to recognize Achieving the Dream colleges that design and implement college-wide approaches that promote student success and result in significant, sustainable institutional improvement. Successful colleges put in place policies, processes, and programs that reinforce and build on each other to improve student achievement and meet equity goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Members in the News: Harper College Receives National Award for Improving Student Outcomes&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Arsallah Shairzay, Dean of Early College and Advanced Placement Program&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; at the Friendship Collegiate Academy in Washington, DC was presented the William U. Harris Award of Excellence. This award recognizes an individual from a member institution who has demonstrated extraordinary leadership skills in the field of education, a record of service that has inspired, the ability to prepare and connect young people to college, and a genuine commitment to mentoring education leaders in an environment that supports their development and growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doranna Tindle, Principal of Friendship Tech Prep High School in Washington, DC presented the award to Arsallah and said, &quot;Dr. Shairzay’s work is the work of cultivating minds and changing lives for the better….the long and arduous task of leveling the playing field and getting marginalized and underserved students into and through college is gritty and difficult on the ground. Dr. Shairzay has done this work with unwavering passion and without asking for honor or adulation every single day for over a decade. I am happy to say that I am a product of Dr. Shairzay’s intentional development and I stand here as a mere representative of the hundreds of students, teachers, leaders, and parents he has invested in and developed over the years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bernard P. Ireland Recognition Award was presented to Rodney Morrison, Associate Provost for Enrollment and Retention Management at Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY.  The award recognizes an individual with a commitment to improving humanity through education, by demonstrating a record of service to young people in the easing of the transition from high school to college, and distinguishing themselves as a change agent in their constituency. It is the highest individual award that is given to Middle States Regional Assembly members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When asked about Rodney’s contributions to students, colleagues remember him as one of the enrollment professionals that truly puts long term student success as a priority” said David Adams, Vice President, Middle States Region, who presented the award. “He cares about outcomes and not just initial short term enrollment decisions, and is a strong advocate for providing students with the supports they need to be successful in higher education. Despite the confusing and overwhelming process of finding the right college, his compassionate personality puts families at ease. As students look back at their college years, they remember Rodney as a person who had a strong impact on them getting into, staying, and graduating from college”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These accolades were conferred on January 28, 2016, at the Middle States Regional Forum, held in Baltimore, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Education Leaders Honored at the Middle States Regional Forum &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

But there’s another College Board program that deserves some attention: the Upward Bound program in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last 17 years, the College Board has been hosting 110 students —75 percent low income, 100 percent African American — in Upward Bound, its four-year college planning program. Students from Anacostia, Ballou, and HD Woodson high schools participate in an intensive summer program and weekly tutoring to help them stay on track for college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To see students’ eyes widen with amazement when they first step on a college campus, travel to other states for college tours, explore career opportunities they never knew existed, and participate in cultural activities, is a heartwarming experience,” said Marlene Guy, director of the Upward Bound Program. “Knowing that we are providing youth with opportunities that they might not otherwise have without Upward Bound continues to reaffirm my purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, an average of 79 percent of students who consistently participated in the Upward Bound program went to college in the fall immediately following their high school graduation. The same could be said for only 45.5 percent of low-income students nationally, and 51.9 percent of students in D.C. schools (both public and private). Upward Bound’s six-year college graduation rate for the classes of 2006 and 2007 was 46 percent, which is on par with the national average for low-income, underrepresented students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those college-going students is Mariah Green, valedictorian of her class at HD Woodson High School, who graduated from the program and got into her dream school, Temple University. As part of the program, she was able to visit more than 20 colleges and find out which would be the best fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Upward Bound helped me with essay-writing and presentation skills,” said Mariah. “I believe I wouldn’t have had the confidence to apply to the colleges I did if it wasn’t for the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upward Bound focuses on academic-skill enhancement and social development through after-school and Saturday academies. Students also attend rigorous six-week summer classes, individual and group college planning, career enrichment experiences, and cultural experiential excursions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students are referred by DCPS and complete an application. Each year, the program receives an average of 70 applications for about 20–25 spots for ninth- and 10th-graders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mariah says the program taught her what to expect in college and how to search for scholarships — a skill that has really paid off. She’ll be attending Temple this fall with the help of two scholarships and has very little to pay out of pocket. She hopes to go into the sports and wellness field and major in kinesiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am so happy I got into Upward Bound! I feel I’m prepared, and I know there are resources to help me succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Upward Bound Shows D.C.

&lt;p&gt;I have spent the last six years as the chancellor of the public schools of the District of Columbia and the last decade working for the school district. For 20 years, I have been focused on improving educational outcomes for students in the nation’s capital. As I conclude my time as a district leader, I see enormous promise in the future of education, and I am very optimistic about what we can do to help students in traditional school districts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my time at the school system, we showed it is possible to make dramatic improvements in only a few years. We improved student performance, increased enrollment, increased student satisfaction, expanded our graduation rate, and improved college access for all students. This success didn’t come easily, but the lessons we learned can be applied to any other school district. In fact, they must be, because we owe it to the more than 90 percent of students in this country who attend public schools to create great opportunities for a bright future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board hosted its second annual Virginia AP Day in Richmond to recognize the achievement of five Commonwealth divisions being named to the AP District Honor Roll. Governor Terry McAuliffe presented each division with an award and met with students, including two who were invited to present to the House Education Committee. Students, teachers, and administrators also had the opportunity to discuss their AP experiences with Steven Staples, Superintendent of Public Instruction, and Holly Coy and Nathalie Molliet-Ribet, Deputy Secretaries of Education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky issued a gubernatorial proclamation declaring February 23 “AP Recognition Day.” The state’s first AP Day included legislative visits for students and teachers, acknowledgement in the House and Senate chambers, and a formal recognition ceremony hosted by the Commissioner of Education and the Deputy Secretary of Education and Workforce to honor Kentucky’s eight winning AP District Honor Roll districts. Kentucky’s Teacher of the Year, Ron Skillern—who happens to be an AP U.S. Government and Politics instructor—joined as a special guest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Texas, AP students and teachers were honored from the floors of both the House of Representatives and Senate. New York AP students were greeted at the Capitol by Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan and Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul, who encouraged students by saying, “The effort you’re putting in now in high school to obtain a college-level education is going to help you in a 1,000 different ways that you don’t know right now, including helping you save money towards college tuition later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students and educators in Austin spoke animatedly about how AP has touched their lives. A student from Katy High School remarked, “I’ve been able to explore a lot of subjects in a controlled environment, where all my teachers are there to support me. It makes me feel like I’m really prepared to go out into the real world.” Brenham High School Coach Trenton Hall discussed the importance of bringing AP Computer Science courses to his school to ensure that students earn college credit for the great work they are doing already—this year they used a 3D printer to create prosthetic hands for children in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maggie Wolf from Tomball High School in Texas was excited to participate in AP Day and see how her voice can help raise awareness around the importance of the AP program. Alexander Verdieu from the High School for Enterprise, Business, and Technology in New York City believes that taking AP Calculus will help him know what to expect when he gets to college. An AP Calculus AB and BC teacher from Texas expressed the same sentiment. Her eyes welled up with tears when she explained that her AP students come back each year to tell her how prepared they felt for college and marveled. “It never gets old,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;AP Day Celebrated in the Kentucky, New York, Texas, and Virginia State Legislatures&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

At this special event, participating colleges not only offer advice and support to these students, but also grant on-site admission decisions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost 100 D.C. area students—armed with copies of transcripts and SAT scores, ready to have conversations with admission officials—gathered at the Marriott Wardman Park for this year’s event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www-origin.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/HBCU%20fair%204.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height:350px; width:527px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brianna Green, a senior at Columbia Heights Educational Campus, was one of the many students who arrived with a complete application, ready to take advantage of the opportunity. All Access was at the event and captured Brianna’s good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jElliTsWhjk?rel=0&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t know he was doing on-site [admissions]. I thought it was going to take a while for him to tell me if I was accepted or not, but it happened,” said Brianna, as she chuckled in amazement. “So everything fell in my lap for Norfolk [University]. I guess that’s like destined or something.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HBCU college fair also allows students to participate in workshops, led by experienced HBCU educational professionals, that focus on everything from how financial aid can make college more affordable to preparing for the full college experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www-origin.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/HBCU%20FAIR%205.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height:350px; width:527px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fair has grown every year; this year’s hosted the largest number of HBCUs yet, providing more options for students. After all was said and done, more than half of all the applications submitted on-site were granted admission. A few students were even offered scholarships to defray college costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board congratulates all students who participated, and thanks the following HBCUs for their support: Alabama State University, Montgomery, AL; Claflin University, Orangeburg, SC; Dillard University, New Orleans, LA; North Carolina A&amp;amp;T State University, Greensboro, NC; North Carolina Central University, Durham, NC; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, VA; Savannah State University, Savannah, GA; Shaw University, Raleigh, NC; University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.; University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Princess Anne, MD; and Virginia State University, St. Petersburg, VA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;HBCU College Fair Clears a Path for D.C.

&lt;p&gt;“Do a little bit more,” Kauffman said. “It will change not only the lives of the young people you work with and for, but it will change your own life, too.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kauffman told the story of her own childhood. When she was very young, her parents moved the family from an Indian reservation to the public housing projects of Seattle, where Kauffman and her six siblings were often left alone to take care of themselves. One day, in third grade, Kauffman arrived at school late. When she entered the classroom, her teacher immediately took her hand and led her to the restroom. There, the teacher, Mrs. Huntington, washed Kauffman’s face, combed her hair, and helped her to correctly button her dress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Here was an adult helping me,” Kauffman said. “Mrs. Huntington didn’t have to wash my face, comb my hair, and button my dress — but she was doing a little bit more.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Throughout my life,” she continued, “there have been people who have helped me along the way, people who did more than they had to do. Because of them, I was able to achieve the successes I did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After she finished her talk, Kauffman took questions from the audience. A student asked her, “What is your definition of success?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kauffman paused a moment. “Right now,” she said, “it’s to be authentic and tell the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Doing ‘a Little Bit More’ Can Mean a Lot&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Maria Adams Davidson of Montgomery College began by speaking about the unique situation of community colleges, like her own, which enroll substantial numbers of first-generation students. Among Montgomery’s initiatives to support these students is its data-driven Student Success Score Card, a set of indicators that tracks academic achievement and then provides actionable information to improve individual student outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khristina Gonzalez, from Princeton University, talked about her school’s Freshman Scholars Institute, a seven-week summer program that gives 80 incoming students, many of whom are the first in their families to go to college, the opportunity to experience the intellectual and social life of college before the fall semester begins. Kevin Hudson, also from Princeton, noted that the Freshman Scholars Institute and a number of other initiatives at the university seek to answer the same core question: “How do high-achieving, low-income or first-generation college students develop the social capital and cultural capital required to thrive?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tevera Stith, who runs the KIPP Through College program for KIPP DC, a network of high-performing Washington charter schools, emphasized the importance of focusing on college completion at all levels of education. “At KIPP schools,” Stith said, “what it takes to get a student through college is everybody’s business.” It’s not enough, she continued, to celebrate when a first-generation student is accepted to college — it’s important to remain engaged with such students, and to help and encourage them to finish what they’ve started. “We have it written all over the walls at our schools,” she said. “Finish, finish, finish.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Addressing the Needs of First-Generation Students&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Sixty students gathered at the Capitol in Albany on Tuesday, March 15, for the &lt;strong&gt;Student and Teacher&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Legislative Day&lt;/strong&gt;. They had one mission: to share their Advanced Placement success stories with legislators and key policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Joseph P. Dragone, Superintendent of Schools of Ballston Spa Central School District and a College Board Trustee, welcomed students and thanked them for their support and success in AP. “To meet with lawmakers and talk about process — and to talk about what is important to you — is a unique opportunity,” he told them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students visited legislators’ offices throughout the day to spread the message that many students in New York don’t have the opportunity to take AP courses. More funding is needed, they argued, to make sure every student gets to experience the benefits of taking an AP course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York State Senator Richard Funke, who serves on the Higher Education Committee, spoke to students about his efforts to expand AP access for all New York state students: “We need to create a statewide program to enable school districts to create new AP offerings and expand what they have,” he said. “Every student, no matter their school district — rural, city, suburban — no matter their financial means, all of them should have access to a variety of AP programs, and they shouldn’t have to worry about funding for the exam.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Funke, and Senator Carl Louis Marcellino, the Chairman of the Senate Education Committee, were part of the 60 legislators who agreed to meet with students throughout the day. “We are here to listen,” Marcellino told students. “And the more we listen, the more we learn.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaiah Mondesir, a student at Medgar Evers Preparatory School in Brooklyn, made the trip to Albany to share his experiences taking seven AP courses. “We met with Senator Rivera and he told us about the process that was necessary to make certain educational policies happen. He feels AP exams are extremely important for students, especially for students who don’t necessarily have access to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sabrina Mendoza, a student at the School of the Arts, Imagination, and Inquiry in Manhattan, said she enjoyed talking to legislators and their staff: “You can see the happiness on their face when you speak about your AP experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another key guest at during the day was Jhone Ebert&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;Senior Deputy Commissioner for Education Policy for New York State Education Department, who also spoke to students about the value of taking AP courses. “I want to see our future grow,” she said. “I look at you and all of you have potential.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That message was not lost on Zachary Douglas, a senior at Ballston Spa High School in Ballston Spa, NY, who told lawmakers’ taking AP Physics has been the number one influence in shaping his interest in mechanical engineering. “I am very thankful for the opportunities that have allowed me to learn what I want to do,” he shared. “I feel every student who wants to go to college should get an opportunity to take AP so they too can get the accelerated learning opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These students not only had the unique opportunity to learn how education policy is implemented, but they also taught lawmakers that taking AP courses has given them the confidence to speak up and fight to level the playing field for all students. &lt;/p&gt;
