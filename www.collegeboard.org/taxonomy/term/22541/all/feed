&lt;p&gt;We rely heavily on the College Board’s CLEP program to validate students’ prior learning. This year, we received over 4,000 CLEP score reports from the College Board that we were able to apply toward students’ degree programs. We were also an early pioneer in online, asynchronous learning. The flexibility of our programs allows us to serve students who may not necessarily be well-served by the traditional college experience. To that end, Thomas Edison State College has partnered with the Saylor Academy – a DC-based non-profit organization committed to driving down the cost of education – to provide students with an affordable pathway to an Associates of Science in Business Administration degree. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Thomas Edison State College &lt;em&gt;Open Course Option&lt;/em&gt; allows motivated, self-directed students to leverage what they learn working through the free online courses offered by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saylor.org/&quot;&gt;Saylor Academy&lt;/a&gt;, and on their own, using up to 10 CLEP exams and our own exam program to earn real college credit. The Open Course Option is entirely self-paced, which means that students are able to complete their studies entirely on their own schedule, completely independent from semesters and deadlines. One other great advantage of this program is the price. Students can earn an ASBA through the Open Course Option for as little as &lt;strong&gt;$3,100&lt;/strong&gt; for in-state students and &lt;strong&gt;$3,400&lt;/strong&gt; for out-of-state students. That’s a savings of over 85% when compared with the average cost of an Associate’s Degree in the United States.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/AA%20Chart.png&quot; style=&quot;height:231px; width:400px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When students complete their Saylor coursework, they return to Thomas Edison State College ready to demonstrate what they have learned by successfully completing one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tesu.edu/degree-completion/earning-credit.cfm&quot;&gt;many assessments&lt;/a&gt; used to validate college-learning, such as portfolio assessment, CLEP, or one of the Thomas Edison State College Examination Program (TECEP®) exams. In some cases, students can earn credit via Saylor Academy’s own &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saylor.org/credit/&quot;&gt;NCCRS and ACE CREDIT reviewed exams&lt;/a&gt;. Once a student successfully completes an assessment, the credits can be applied towards the student’s degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Saylor Academy courses have been crafted by experienced professors using entirely free resources such as video lectures, textbooks, and online activities. Many have been augmented with both formative and summative assessments. Before Thomas Edison State College launched this program, each Saylor course underwent an intense review process to determine its alignment with the college’s own programmatic and course-level objectives. In some cases, we worked with Saylor to revise the relevant course areas. Many Saylor courses have also been aligned with CLEP exam content coverage. This has helped to provide our students with a seamless experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far over 225 students have enrolled at the Saylor Academy and begun taking courses aligned with the Open Course Option track. Of those, 38 have gone on to enroll at Thomas Edison State College and started working towards their degree. Still others have used the flexibility of our program to advance their educational goals beyond the scope of an Associate’s degree.  One student, Rodney Morris McCoy, was interviewed about using our Open Course Option to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration. He said, “Like most people, my schedule is filled with multiple responsibilities from work and family.  Just finding the time to study can be a challenge in itself. I enjoyed the freedom that the Open Course Option gave me in completing the courses.”  We believe that this model can be duplicated at other institutions and that it can be used effectively to bring down the cost of tuition, while simultaneously providing students with additional flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing&quot;&gt;College Board’s Trends in College Pricing Report&lt;/a&gt;, the average two-year Associates Degree costs $17,310 for in-state students and $21,706 for out-of-state students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Thomas Edison State College’s Open Course Option Opens Doors for Adult Learners&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>Lessons from the ACCUPLACER &amp; CLEP Conference </title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://accuplacer.collegeboard.org/educator/why-accuplacer&quot;&gt;ACCUPLACER&lt;/a&gt; is an integrated system of computer-adaptive assessments that includes tests in reading, writing, and English-as-a-Second Language reading and writing, and various math subjects. It is designed to help educators understand a students’ skill level in a particular subject area, to ensure they are placed in the appropriate college course that fits their needs.  ACCUPLACER can also provide a detailed analysis of a student’s strengths and weaknesses and be used as a diagnostic tool to determine college readiness and academic preparedness. More than 7.5 million ACCUPLACER tests are administered each year in more than 1,500 high schools and colleges, and it’s safe to say that every one of those institutions uses this integrated system of assessments a little differently. It did not take long to realize that the answer to this question is that a typical day in the life of an ACCUPLCAER user does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buzz about &lt;a href=&quot;https://accuplacer.collegeboard.org/educator/next-generation&quot;&gt;next-generation ACCUPLACER&lt;/a&gt; enhancements was palpable throughout the conference—in spite of (or perhaps because of) the 115 degree desert heat. During a session led by Antoinette Crockrell, Executive Director of the ACCUPLACER program, members of College Board’s Assessment Design and Development team focused closely on the technical aspects of the changes. Presenters spoke about concepts like Item Response Theory and Differential Item Functioning, and as those in the room who were not statisticians (like me) were diligently taking notes, participants posed questions that clearly indicated their desire to understand how these changes would impact their students. In aligning ACCUPLACER to the same content domain continuum as the SAT Suite of Assessments—the content and skills that research shows matter most for college success—what does this mean for practice opportunities? How can educators help students understand which assessment they should take, and when? What specific knowledge and skills will the new tests measure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This became a common theme of conference attendees—understanding how policy and product enhancements will impact their students. Those that rely on the simplicity and usefulness of ACCUPLACER as a tool for placement and diagnostics are first and foremost concerned with how they can leverage the enhancements the College Board is making, to make the system work better for their students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This focus persisted as conversations shifted to and from technical specifications of the tests to the changing educational and political climate for community college and non-traditional students. During the keynote panel discussion aptly named “Challenge, Change, and Opportunity”, panelists discussed the changing identity of today’s college student, federal support for financial aid, and a shift to talking about college &lt;em&gt;completion&lt;/em&gt; rather than admission as the ultimate goal for today’s student. Panelists discussed the idea of changing Pell Grants to include not only tuition for low-income students, but also room and board—significant costs that can be prohibitive of attending and completing college in and of themselves. The value of ACCUPLACER and CLEP for students who don’t follow the “traditional” path of a college student was reiterated during this session and breakouts to follow; specifically the flexibility, accuracy, relative cost, and potential savings that these products bring to the table (stay tuned for more All Access coverage on CLEP—you can read more about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://clep.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked away from Las Vegas with a certainty that the way we think about a college student in this country is fundamentally different than it was even a decade ago—and will continue to evolve. I may not have been able to adequately capture a normal day in the life of an ACCUPLACER user, but I can say educators are eager for ACCUPLACER to evolve as well—and continue to be a tool used by colleges, high schools, and community organizations as they work to adapt their policies and practices to support these students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Lessons from the ACCUPLACER &amp;amp; CLEP Conference &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
