The Colloquium is a gathering of professionals at all levels of higher education to discuss the topics and issues that matter most to them and their students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luna, a first generation college student, kicked off the conversations for the next two days with a keynote address that focused on what public education means to the common good. At a time when policy makers and the general public alike are questioning the value of higher education, Luna described the imperative of all higher education stakeholders to disseminate a common understanding that education is the key to choice, independence, and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He challenged participants to consider the following question: Does higher education as a holistic institution truly care about all students?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Colloquium, attendees will bring this question to bear as they discuss the most salient issues in higher education right now—including how college costs are affecting the middle class, communications strategies around the value of a college education, and the debate surrounding college rankings and ratings systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luna’s own college experience continues to inform his work to this day. He shared anecdotes about his time as an undergraduate at Stanford, which was not without setbacks. His message that the shifting demographics of this country necessitate a continuous shift in the approach of higher education institutions to serving and supporting all students set the tone for the next few days, and energized participants to prepare for these tough conversations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Paul Luna Challenges Colloquium 2015 Participants to Rethink their Approach to Serving All Students &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I attended last year and learned an enormous amount. I think it’s a great opportunity to get reenergized about the core of what we do. Over the course of the year we get caught up in the semantics of our day to day jobs and it’s wonderful to be reminded of the purpose and mission of our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We just heard from panelists about the importance of communicating about the price of college. As a financial aid professional, talk about your reaction to &lt;a href=&quot;https://colloquium.collegeboard.org/program&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this session&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m surprised by how infrequently communications comes up in terms of student aid access. I was also surprised by how much frustration there is around aid communications, but I understand why it exists, especially when you look at the resources colleges devote to admissions communications, or policy maker communications. It’s striking to think that aid officers feel so badly under-resourced in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we feel like it is somehow crass to message around aid, but the reality is, it’s a public service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools that do cost communications best, in terms of ease of use and presentation, are for-profit institutions and tuition-dependent small colleges, and that’s because they have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially for those of us at an institution with a public service mission as a core part of our identity, we have to start looking at aid communications in that context. Done right, it’s a service to students and families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you end up working in higher education?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to work for Shirley Ort, who is one of the true believers in the core mission of higher education. I met Shirley when I was a student journalist at UNC and she was one of the most consistently open and helpful people in higher ed. I was lucky enough to work with her on some one-off projects after graduation, and now I get to work with her full time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working for Shirley has been a great chance to learn the ins and outs of a very complicated an increasingly important corner of higher ed—and there was no way I was going to miss out on that chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you had a piece of advice or encouragement for someone thinking about pursuing a career in higher education, particularly in the financial aid arena, what would it be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial aid is the most fascinating areas of public policy to me. It is one of the most complex and politically contentious public benefits and in that sense it is a great place to gain experience to pursue a career in politics, public affairs, economics—it is widely applicable no matter where you see your career going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s valuable about Colloquium, in particular, compared to other higher education conferences?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colloquium is much more conversational, and a little rawer than most higher education conferences I’ve been to. In that sense, it’s more productive. I would say there is more honesty in the way people are talking to each other, and I hope some of that spills over into our public discussions of these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Overheard at Colloquium: Attendee Eric Johnson Talks Communications and Financial Aid&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>College and University Presidents Discuss Higher Ed’s Role in Serving the Public Good</title>

&lt;p&gt;That was the overarching message participants at the Higher Ed Colloquium received from the “Conversation with Presidents” that opened the first full day of events On January 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in Delray Beach, FL. Following Paul Luna’s keynote the previous evening, during which he challenged the audience of higher education professionals to address the needs of &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; students, the session invited a careful and critical look into how individual student populations may influence institutional policy and culture rather than the other way around. Catharine Bond Hill, Wallace D. Loh, and Michael A. Sorrell, presidents of Vassar College, the University of Maryland, and Paul Quinn College, respectively, each offered ideas and advice that, though sometimes seemingly at odds, have contributed significantly to the success of their particular institution – success defined largely by their ability to produce graduates who are both employable and civic-minded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Montoya, the College Board’s vice president for higher education and international outreach, asked the panel a broad but daunting question: “How do colleges and universities need to step it up?”  It turns out that the different answers the presidents gave were shaped by a shared goal: to do what is best for the communities they serve.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For President Sorrell, that means placing a very conscious effort on confronting the issues that most directly affect the low-income students in his care.  And in their case, he says, their lives will be changed most by changing the urban environment in which they live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve decided to marry education with the public good, treat it as its own educational endeavor,” said Sorrell. “The public good occurs when you actually weigh into the issues and solve them. The needs of the community supersede the individual.”  As an example, Sorrell highlighted the dismantling of Paul Quinn’s football program and the transformation of its football field into an organic urban farm that now serves the local community, otherwise classified as a food desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation and entrepreneurship for the sake of the public good was also a theme of President Loh’s remarks. Loh likewise singled out a nutrition-related project at the University of Maryland, the Food Recovery Network, which provides food that would otherwise go to waste to people in need. But innovation and entrepreneurship should be the watchwords of the university, said Loh, primarily to solve “the biggest issue of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century: jobs, jobs, jobs.” At a large economically diverse institution like the University of Maryland, he argued, it is imperative to conceive of ways to educate everyone better, and at a lower cost for the more financially strapped. “Why are the low income students subsidizing the wealthy?” he asked. “I think we should raise tuition to help the low income students. Institutions must have autonomy [to make these decisions].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Hill warned that increasing income inequality will lead to problems greater than personal student debt. The likelihood that students from low income families will have access to educational opportunity at all, she said, is becoming ever more doubtful.  As a result, “I think we’ll see social stresses that will make this a country we don’t want to live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How can we make sure higher ed is part of the solution, and not reinforcing societal problems?” Hill asked.  “How do we frame this argument at the local level to get our states to reinvest in our students education as part of the public good?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hill agreed that serving one’s students and serving the larger good are not mutually exclusive, and, in fact, that you can’t do one without the other. “We have on obligation, even as a private institution, to serve the public interest,” she said.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College and University Presidents Discuss Higher Ed’s Role in Serving the Public Good&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
