&lt;p&gt;Joanna Garcia – Oxnard 12th&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;grader&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I had no idea what I was doing until I watched the preview video.  I really liked how they gave you examples on the problems. On the final exam, I was never really able to go into that. I thought it was my computer — it would always keep loading and loading — but I did print it out, which I thought was really cool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amairee Stokes – Columbus 10th-grader&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t know what the SAT was; I was glad I had Khan Academy because they had a whole SAT section and it tells what the SAT is about, things that are going to be on the test, and how the scoring is done. I like [how] if you get a question wrong, they have little notes, they explain why that answer is the right one. I really like how Khan Academy has all the videos and stuff if you don’t understand something. I am really grateful I got the chance to go on Khan Academy because I now know what the SAT is about. “&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our College Board team took copious notes and promised to improve the student experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You should do commercials to let people know about the free SAT practice, on YouTube and stuff like that,” said Joanna. We say, let the cameras roll!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;What Students Are Really Saying About Official SAT Practice&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;To bring these results to more students in the state of California, the College Board has joined the National Rural Education Association, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ffa.org/home&quot;&gt;National FFA Organization&lt;/a&gt;, local county and district superintendents, and local higher education institutions to launch the &lt;strong&gt;Official SAT Practice Rural and Small Town Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017-2018, districts who participate in the challenge will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;receive tools and support for Official SAT Practice implementation,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;gain access to enhanced data reports, and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;be eligible for VIP college visits and cash prizes based on student usage numbers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Superintendents from rural and small California districts can sign up by July 30 at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/OSPRuralChallenge&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;http://bit.ly/OSPRuralChallenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California educators wishing to learn more may contact Tierney Kraft, senior director, SAT Student Success, at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:tkraft@collegeboard.org&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tkraft@collegeboard.org&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work was made possible through the College Board’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/counseling-admissions-academic/college-board-and-czi-partner-provide-0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;two-year partnership with the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (CZI), which launched in May 2017 to provide personalized pathways to college success for millions of students. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;California Rural and Small Town OSP Challenge&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

We want to be there for you in that moment.” So began Elizabeth Slavitt, director of content for Khan Academy (KA), as she spoke at the Forum’s closing plenary about the real-time benefits of the online learning tool and the organization’s relationship with the College Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary goals of KA, said Slavitt, is to “unblock barriers for students to achieve their goals.” So when David Coleman, president of the College Board, called her office to talk about the redesigned SAT and his desire to partner with KA to level the playing field for all students, it seemed like a perfect match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That partnership has resulted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an online tool with full-length practice SAT tests created by the College Board and practice items developed by Khan Academy in close collaboration with the makers of the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are no ordinary practice items. They are interactive questions that “learn” what each student is already good at, and where each student could use some help. The tool then produces customized practice recommendations to meet the specific needs of each student. “We build personalized learning experiences,” said Slavitt. “We let students go at their own pace, offer step-by-step [answer] explanations, and congratulate them when they achieve their goals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help always on-the-move students keep up with their practice, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/practice/daily-practice-app&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Daily Practice for the New SAT app&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is also available for free. In addition to providing the same practice questions, answer explanations, and personalized recommendations as the website, it can score a student’s paper-and-pencil practice test in a matter of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is great news, but it means nothing if students don’t know about it. “While we’ve gotten rid of the financial gap,” said Slavitt, “I suspect we still have the information gap.” And the students most in need of these tools – the low-income, lower-resourced students – are most likely to exist in circles where this is not being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please help us spread the word,” Slavitt urged. “We want every single student who could use this to know it exists — to know there are a bunch of adults who value their future enough to help them achieve their dreams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Close the Information Gap: Tell Students About Khan Academy&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;New York — A year ago today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 133, 207); text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word; font-weight: bold; background: transparent;&quot;&gt;Official SAT&lt;span&gt;®&lt;/span&gt; Practice&lt;/a&gt; for the new SAT went live on KhanAcademy.org, making free, world-class, personalized online practice available for all students. There are now more than 1.4 million unique users on Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy — this represents four times the total population of students who use all commercial test prep classes in a year combined. Data show that the practice platform is reaching students across race, ethnicities, and income levels — mirroring the percentage of SAT takers. Almost half of all SAT takers on March 5 used Official SAT Practice to prepare, causing a 19 percent drop in the number of students who paid for SAT prep resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board and Khan Academy, a leader in online education, developed the interactive practice tools to create a world-class, tailored experience to help all students, regardless of income level or background, prepare for the new SAT and college-level courses. Official SAT Practice supports and reinforces what students are learning in the classroom by helping them focus on the knowledge and skills essential for college readiness. These are the only SAT practice tools built by the makers of the test, along with the online learning expertise of Khan Academy. When students receive their SAT or PSAT/NMSQT&lt;span&gt;®&lt;/span&gt; results, they can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlveV0131Cw&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 133, 207); text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word; font-weight: bold; background: transparent;&quot;&gt;connect&lt;/a&gt; their College Board and Khan Academy accounts to get free, personalized study recommendations for the SAT. This represents one of the largest examples of personalized learning in the world: In less than six months, more than 450,000 students have taken advantage of that feature and have been able to focus their practice on areas that need the most work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Into the second year, the College Board and Khan Academy will introduce new features, including additional practice tests, an opportunity to get help from subject-matter experts, live instruction sessions on Facebook Live, and new partnerships to help more students prepare for the SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We partnered with Khan Academy to revolutionize the way students practice for the SAT. We did this by providing free, world-class preparation for everyone. Now, one year later, students are seizing that opportunity in ways that exceed our highest expectations,” said College Board President David Coleman. “For the first time, there is equality of access to SAT practice. Students from all backgrounds are empowered and are using these practice tools. In classrooms from Orange County, Florida, to Long Beach, California, educators and students across the country are working together to prepare for success on the SAT and beyond.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our mission at Khan Academy is a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere, and college readiness is a crucial part of that,” said Khan Academy Founder and Executive Director Sal Khan. “We partnered with the College Board because we wanted to help students achieve their goals through hard work and real learning, regardless of how much money they have. We’ve been humbled by the great reception Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy has received so far, but this is just the beginning. We’re in this for the long haul and are invested in building the world’s best SAT resources — that just happen to be free.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official SAT Practice features four full-length practice tests written by the College Board and made available through Khan Academy. More tests will be added over time, including a fifth practice test this summer. Official SAT Practice also includes more than four thousand practice questions; video lessons; diagnostic quizzes to identify skills to focus on; personalized practice recommendations directly tied to specific skills on the test; and instant feedback on answers so students are always learning and seeing their progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help as many students as possible, the College Board and Khan Academy are partnering with school districts, nonprofit organizations, and college access organizations that are working side by side with students and integrating Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy tools into their classrooms and programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students using Official SAT Practice have emphasized the importance of building confidence through practice. The College Board and Khan Academy created a video —&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enLRwKjIOAM&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 133, 207); text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word; font-weight: bold; background: transparent;&quot;&gt;“Confidence”&lt;/a&gt; — celebrating the ability of students to walk in on test day knowing they’ve done what it takes to be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;One Year Since Launch, Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy Is Leveling the Playing Field for Students&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;“Many times in the rural areas, we don’t have access to resources that other more urban and suburban areas have. This is an opportunity to help our rural schools,” said Pratt. “The biggest thing is that 20 hours practice has been linked to a 115-point increase on the SAT, which is a big dramatic jump that could benefit our students in rural communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superintendents from rural and small California districts can sign up for the Challenge by August 15 at &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/OSPRuralChallenge&quot;&gt;http://bit.ly/OSPRuralChallenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Bringing Official SAT Practice to Rural and Small Towns&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newark, NJ&lt;/em&gt; – Newark Public Schools (NPS) today announced an expansive partnership with the College Board to further the district’s goal of increasing the number of students who graduate from high school and pursue a college education. Through this partnership, NPS will work with the College Board to provide expanded access to the Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT®) and the SAT®, as well as a higher quality and quantity of Advanced Placement® (AP®) course work, an important consideration in college applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our partnership with the College Board is critically important to the future long-term academic success of our young men and women. It is time that we offer students in Newark the same opportunities that students across New Jersey have been afforded for a number of years,” said NPS Superintendent Christopher D. Cerf. “The College Board is partnering with us to ensure that students recognize and make the most of the opportunities available to them and realize their tremendous potential.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;District leadership worked with school leaders and educators across the district to gather feedback on the decision and to identify the programs, resources, and assessments that would provide students with the most value. Our partnership with the College Board is designed to increase access to valuable assessments and courses that play a key role in the college admission and success process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT)&lt;/strong&gt;: Beginning this fall, NPS will provide the PSAT/NMSQT to all of the district’s 10th- and 11th-grade students. The PSAT/NMSQT measures the same skills and knowledge as the SAT, so students and educators will be able to monitor progress and identify areas in need of improvement. In addition, PSAT/NMSQT results are the best predictor of a student&#039;s likelihood to succeed in certain AP courses. And, students who take the PSAT/NMSQT can access more than $180 million in expanded scholarship opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAT School Day&lt;/strong&gt;: NPS will participate in SAT School Day in April, providing the test to all 11th-graders at individual schools across the district. SAT School Day helps foster a college-going culture and increases access to college, especially among first-generation college-bound students. SAT School Day is especially beneficial for those students who may otherwise face barriers to standard Saturday administrations and would miss out on this important step in the college-going process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Official SAT Practice Through Khan Academy&lt;/strong&gt;®: All students have access to free, personalized practice through Khan Academy, a leader in online education. Official SAT Practice on khanacademy.org is helping to level the playing field for all students who are interested in taking the SAT and preparing for college. Students who take the PSAT/NMSQT and SAT benefit from these tools, which help reinforce what students are learning in classrooms and focus on the content tested, not just test-taking strategies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The PSAT/NMSQT and SAT are assessments that provide opportunities for students to qualify for financial scholarships, as well as improve their college readiness,” said Superintendent Cerf. “We will stop administering unnecessary tests, and instead focus on providing assessments that offer valuable information to help advance our students’ educational opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NPS and the College Board will also work together to increase the quality and quantity of the Advanced Placement courses offered across the district. The district will begin by offering NPS teachers access to AP Mentoring, a teacher-to-teacher professional development program, to ensure educators are successful in leading AP course work. Research shows that students who succeed in challenging course work, such as Advanced Placement, are more likely to graduate college on time, and have the potential to save time and money through placement and credit-granting policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to partner with Newark Public Schools and the entire community of Newark,” said College Board President and CEO David Coleman. “Assessment without opportunity is a thing of the past. We are committed to partnering with the Newark Public Schools to ensure that every student has access to tests that can deliver powerful benefits, including scholarships, college admission, and course credit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board will expand its acclaimed Access to Opportunity™ program to more Newark students. The College Board will provide high school course work information, college application fee waivers, and critical financial aid guidance to Newark students. Additionally, the College Board will work with community-based organizations, such as the Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club, to train them on the use of Khan Academy practice tools so students can continue their academic preparation after the normal school day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Newark Public Schools Partners with the College Board to Expand Student Access to SAT Testing and AP Course Work&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Challenge connected students from the nation’s largest urban public school systems to free Official SAT Practice, in an effort to boost college and career readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-eight big-city districts volunteered for the inaugural challenge, and five districts were honored with the following awards: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;California’s &lt;strong&gt;Long Beach Unified School District&lt;/strong&gt; received the “MVP” prize for having the highest overall percentage of students linking their College Board and Khan Academy accounts to receive free, personalized SAT practice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;California’s&lt;strong&gt; Fresno Unified School District &lt;/strong&gt;received the “Growth” prize for having the highest overall percent increase of students linking their College Board and Khan Academy accounts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Florida’s&lt;strong&gt; Orange County Public Schools in Orlando&lt;/strong&gt; received the “Student: Proof of Practice” prize for having the highest average weekly percentage of students with active Official SAT Practice accounts.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Colorado&#039;s&lt;strong&gt; Denver Public Schools&lt;/strong&gt; received the “Time: Proof of Practice” prize with its students logging the most minutes on Official SAT Practice per week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Illinois&#039;s &lt;strong&gt;Chicago Public Schools&lt;/strong&gt; received the “Problems Completed: Proof of Practice” prize with its students completing the most Official SAT Practice problems per week. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these districts will receive money to put toward initiatives that advance student success and opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are many success stories to share about the hard work and incredible growth that our districts and students made through this challenge,” says Council of Great City Schools Executive Director Michael Casserly. “We’re proud of the 28 school districts that stepped up to the challenge and hope others will follow.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our partnership with the Council of the Great City Schools and Khan Academy is helping bring these free, highly personalized practice tools to every corner of the country,” says College Board President and CEO David Coleman. “But make no mistake: behind every story of a student practicing on Khan Academy and succeeding on the SAT is a caring adult. We applaud the community of leaders across the five winning districts for their commitment to adopting these tools and propelling their students forward.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students who&#039;ve taken the SAT or a PSAT-related assessment can unlock a custom practice plan through Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy that identifies strengths and weaknesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The PSAT is now a diagnostic for Khan Academy,” says Khan Academy founder Sal Khan. “If students share their PSAT score, Khan Academy can use that information to provide tailored practice in math, reading and writing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The College Board needs to open up a new conversation with the counseling community,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, he promised several improvements and enhancements in the coming year, including online access for counselors to students’ PSAT/NMSQT scores one week prior to students, an updated portal that is more usable, one-click access to the K-12 reporting portal, shortening the Student Data Questionnaire (SDQ) while still capturing valuable information from students, improving customer service for educators, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The town hall also highlighted the power of providing transformative educational experiences to all students, and what it looks like when students take advantage of these opportunities. During an on-stage conversation, Coleman and Steve Bumbaugh, Senior Vice President of College and Career Access at the College Board, discussed how the College Board is helping provide all low-income, first-generation, students of color, rural, military, and home-school students with equal access to high-quality practice, counseling, challenging coursework, and other educational resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bumbaugh, who has been a long-time mentor for local DC-area students, talked about his focus on the “power of human relationships with students.” Bumbaugh pointed to the College Board’s work with the College Advising Corps to increase access to college guidance for students who may not have access to a school counselor as a priority for the organization, noting that the College Board needs to clear a path for students to college with the adults and supports that can help a student along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their conversation delved into the role that practice plays in student success, particularly the transformative effect of devoted practice that is sustained over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think practice provides people with the safe space to fail,” Bumbaugh said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman introduced one example of the power of productive practice to the audience: Sabrina Rosales, a high school senior from Cesar E. Chavez High School in Houston. Sabrina used Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy every day Monday through Friday for at least an hour to get ready for the SAT. The result? An increase of 250 points on her SAT compared to her PSAT/NMSQT scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to push myself even further,” she told Coleman and the audience about why she used Official SAT Practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosales, who plans to take the SAT again this fall, will be a first-generation college student and hopes to enroll at University of Texas at Austin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Isn’t it awesome that practice is an equal opportunity employer?” Coleman said. “The integration of assessments and practice that lets kids grow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Looking Back and Looking Ahead at Forum 2016&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an excerpt from the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Standardized test scores matter — higher test scores greatly increase a student&#039;s chances of getting into better, more competitive schools, resulting in more choices for scholarships and financial aid. While teens may get discouraged from re-taking standardized tests if their initial scores are low, the good news is that practice and the use of free online sample prep and testing can make all the difference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just ask Jazmín Regalado of New Mexico.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regalado, 17, is a rising high school senior at Fort Sumner High School. She&#039;ll be the first from her mother’s side of the family to attend and finish college. Regalado wasn’t satisfied with her initial PSAT score (the Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT) test administered by the College Board). She tested in the “red” range: meaning she needed to build her reading and math skills.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instead of becoming discouraged, she sought the advice of a school counselor who told her to sign on to Khan Academy for free online tutorials.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I logged on to the Khan Academy account at least an hour a day—here were some days I’d study for more than an hour,” Regalado said. “I’d look for specific videos for PSAT and SAT practice. I love the way they explain things in the videos. They give you sample problems and then you solve them.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;By the time she took the test again this past spring, her score had increased 101 points. Her SAT score also jumped 120 points when she took it in June.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read Jazmín&#039;s full story on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/road-college-student-shows-improving-standardized-test-scores-takes-practice-n790761&quot;&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt; and watch her talking about Official SAT Practice below. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>11 Ways to Clear a Path to Opportunity</title>

The group shared the stage with Governor Jeb Bush and New Mexico Secretary of Education Hanna Skandera at the 2016 National Summit on Education Reform, hosted by the Foundation for Excellence in Education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman’s remarks began with a reminder that the College Board was founded more than 100 years ago on the idea that merit, not privilege, should determine access to higher education. He opened: “I think if the College Board is to be useful to this country, we must now rededicate ourselves to our original mission. We must dedicate ourselves once again to clearing a path for all students to own their future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then outlined the 11 principles guiding the College Board’s work as we go beyond tests to provide more opportunities to students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen on &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/user-374143842/11-ways-to-clear-a-path-to-opportunity-remarks-by-david-coleman&quot;&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make the SAT more than fair.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The redesigned SAT is making it easier for students to show their best work. How? Gone is the guessing penalty, and gone are obscure “SAT words.” Coleman explained: “The words on the exam are no longer words we use most rarely, but words [students] will use most often in the first year of college.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also noted that there’s now 43 percent more time per question on the SAT than the ACT. “One of the worst things assessment has done in this country is to confuse quick and smart,” Coleman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It&#039;s time to make excellence easier,” he continued. “We want the SAT to be the easiest place for students to show their power, to do their best work. We’re inviting all students—they&#039;ve all got a shot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never give someone only one chance to be great.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coleman described how the redesigned Suite of Assessments—including the PSAT 8/9, PSAT 10, and PSAT/NMSQT—creates a multi-year trajectory, allowing students to see how they’re doing throughout high school. A student’s fate never rests on one test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also clarified: “The PSAT does not predict what you will get on the SAT. No test can tell you your potential… All a test can do is invite you to what you could become, through practice.” He called the PSAT “an invitation to free practice.” Which leads to the next principle—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make practice free for all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent costly test preparation from acting as a barrier to student success on the SAT, the College Board partnered with Khan Academy; together we made high-quality SAT practice free to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of December, 2.5 million students are using Official SAT Practice with Khan Academy, at roughly equal rates—across all income levels, races, and ethnicities. And “there are five times as many students practicing on Khan Academy than all of commercial test preparation combined,” announced Coleman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Practice is an ‘equal opportunity employer,” he said. “Practice works. You can indeed get better at anything if you follow your love and practice.” The two students who joined Coleman and Khan on-stage—who both improved their SAT scores by more than 100 points after using Official SAT Practice—were inspiring testaments to this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fulfill the broken promises of assessment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coleman explained the College Board’s commitment to tracking “opportunities delivered, not just test scores.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though assessments have at best been seen as a way to find “diamonds in the rough and catapult them into opportunity,” the reality is less heartening. Coleman gave the example of students who were in the top ten percent of SAT scorers but the bottom quarter of our nation&#039;s income; despite high test scores, more than half of them do not apply to a single selective college. So the College Board removed a barrier: we worked with our member institutions, and we now give every low-income student who takes the SAT four fee waivers to apply to college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman shared one success story from this initiative: “My favorite moment on the job so far has been when a student posted a picture of his fee waivers on Instagram and said, ‘The College Board sent me fee waivers because I am awesome.’ He did not say, ‘Because I am poor.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End the war between college and career. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;When redesigning the SAT, the College Board worked not only with educators, but with employers. We can’t ask students to work toward college without showing them how they are progressing to careers, said Coleman.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, he shared a new career exploration tool, &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegeboard.roadtripnation.com/&quot;&gt;Roadmap to Careers&lt;/a&gt;, powered by the College Board and Roadtrip Nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prepare a more diverse set of students for STEM fields and degrees specifically, the College Board has also partnered with Project Lead the Way and has launched a new computer science course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/stem/computer-science-principles?excmpid=MTG272-PR-1-prt&quot;&gt;AP Computer Science Principles&lt;/a&gt; (AP CSP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credit is earned, not given. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an American Enterprise Institute report, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aei.org/publication/ap-at-scale-public-school-students-in-advanced-placement-1990-2013/&quot;&gt;AP at Scale: Public school students in Advanced Placement, 1990-2013&lt;/a&gt;,” researcher Nat Malkus points out that while AP participation has increased over the years, neither test scores nor rigor have dropped. “Expanding at scale without sacrificing rigor is the rarest kind of success in public education,” Malkus wrote, “and AP is showing just that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Coleman celebrated the success of AP students and this program, he added: “We have an obligation to be honest with young people and their families before college”—to never give students credits when they haven’t earned it, and to never lead student to believe they’re ready for college-level work if they aren’t. “That’s not a fair bargain for anybody,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No longer allow economies of scale to neglect rural America.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Coleman was happy to announce that more than 2,000 high schools in America signed up for AP Computer Science Principles this year, he stressed the importance of expanding access in &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; kinds of communities— especially in often-overlooked rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through partnerships with &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.org&quot;&gt;Code.org&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pltw.org/our-programs/pltw-computer-science&quot;&gt;Project Lead the Way&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/academic/new-ap-computer-science-principles-course-prominent-computer-science&quot;&gt;National Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, the College Board is offering high-quality computer science curriculum and professional development all across the country, with the goal of implementing AP CSP in every high school in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education is soul craft.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;When we’ve talked about college and career,” said Coleman, “I think we may have forgotten an ancient thing. Education is a precious thing; it involves the life of the soul.”  He described the “gifts” religious education in particular can instill in our students, such as “productive solitude” in an age when “the technology of interruption has far outpaced the technology of concentration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge matters in civic education.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coleman referred to civic education as “the soul of our country—the place for students to get engaged in the world.” He cited the College Board’s new &lt;a href=&quot;https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-united-states-government-and-politics/course&quot;&gt;AP Government and Politics&lt;/a&gt; course as a lively framework, where students deeply study the Constitution, the separation of powers, civil liberties, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End the insanity around the admissions process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since becoming president of the College Board, Coleman has been struck by “the unproductive anxiety that harries children and families throughout the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He encouraged students to focus, in a sustained way, on the few extracurriculars that are most meaningful to them, rather than fill up lines on their college applications with disconnected acitivites. Families, high schools, and colleges alike “need to allow more time for family, faith, and fun,” said Coleman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;11&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parents and families must come first.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;By redesigning score reports, providing additional fee waivers, increasing scholarships, and increasing access for students from military families, the College Board wants to be a partner to students and the caring adults in their lives. “We are redesigning everything we do to give families everything they need in one click,” said Coleman.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, with their students’ permission, teachers, counselors, college access professionals, parents, and other educators can use new coach tools to create classes of students, see their progress, and provide targeted help based on their practice activities. Through these new features, it’s easier than ever for educators to help their students prepare for the SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coach tools also provide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recommended SAT skills for teachers to work on with their students, based on the needs of their class, and recommended lessons plans. There are 16 Math lessons, 16 Evidence-Based Reading and Writing lessons, and 4 essay lessons; each one is designed for a 45 minute class and was created by teachers, for teachers. Check out the new lesson plans &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/k12-educators/advising-instruction/official-sat-practice-lesson-plans&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. (These are also accessible within the coach tools themselves.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Information on students’ progress, including their upcoming SAT test dates, problems completed, time spent practicing, and practice tests scheduled. Coaches can also see students’ recent activity, including questions attempted, answer choices, and practice test scores.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some school districts have already started taking advantage of these tools. In Pinellas, Florida, Pinellas County School District teachers are using the coach tools and lesson plans to run a semester-long course for students; this work is part of an initiative to increase the number of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.floridastudentfinancialaid.org/ssfad/bf/&quot;&gt;Florida Bright Future Scholars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalmerit.org/s/1758/interior.aspx?sid=1758&amp;amp;gid=2&amp;amp;pgid=424&quot;&gt;National Merit Scholarship&lt;/a&gt; recipients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tikini Thompson, Director for State and District Partnerships in Florida, said: “I used [the coach tools] today, and they are AWESOME! I had a meeting with a few more school districts in Florida and showed them the latest features live. They were so excited about it, they gave them a standing ovation.” She also noted that teachers are impressed with how thorough the lesson plans are—they incorporate objectives, teacher notes, activities for the students, and homework. &lt;/p&gt;

It’s just one of the ways the new SAT is leveling the playing field and making it easier for students to show their best work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, more than four million students received their scores from the October 2016 PSAT/NMSQT. Every one of those students now has access to a free, customized SAT practice plan on &lt;a href=&quot;file://nyodska01/aelwell/Link%20Day/satpractice.org&quot;&gt;Official SAT Practice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 18, students can help even more of their peers get ready for the SAT, simply by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIkCoQoZ21U&quot;&gt;connecting their College Board and Khan Academy accounts and sending their 2016 PSAT/NMSQT results to Khan Academy&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll donate laptops to libraries in the district* with the highest percentage of 2016 PSAT/NMSQT test takers who connect their accounts between &lt;strong&gt;October 1, 2016, and January 18, 2017&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; in the three districts* with the highest percentage who connect accounts any time on &lt;strong&gt;January 18&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help us spread the word! Tell your friends and family about this effort to make sure all students have access to the tools they need to get ready for the SAT. You can use the following language to share the news on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jan. 18 is our #SATPractice Challenge. Link your College Board and Khan Academy Accounts and get ready for the SAT. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.satpractice.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;www.satpractice.org&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The response was overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 20,000 students linked their accounts on that day—more than on any one day since the launch of Official SAT Practice. Every student who connected their accounts will receive SAT practice recommendations tailored to their needs that will make it easier for them to show their best work on the SAT and get ready for college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three districts with the highest percentages of 2016 PSAT/NMSQT test takers who linked their accounts on January 18 were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crown Point Community School Corporation, Indiana: 46.17%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brunswick City School District, Ohio: 40.94%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Princeton City Schools, Ohio: 35.69%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re also awarding laptops to the district with the highest percentage of 2016 PSAT/NMSQT takers who linked accounts between October 1 and January 18. Michigan’s Brighton Area School District topped that list, with 77.84% of their 2016 PSAT/NMSQT test takers connecting their accounts during that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to all the winners! We’re thrilled that so many students took advantage of the opportunity to help out their local libraries and help themselves by signing up for Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy—the only free, official, personalized SAT practice tools available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you’ll keep encouraging your students to take advantage of this one-of-a-kind SAT practice resource. Remember: They can sign up at any time at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.satpractice.org/&quot;&gt;satpractice.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*In order for a district to qualify, it must have had at least 400 students who took the October 2016 PSAT/NMSQT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;And the Winners of the SAT® Practice Challenge Are…&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The SAT replaces the ACT as the state&#039;s college entrance exam. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Bids were received by both the College Board and ACT. The selection committee, composed of representatives from school districts across the state, opted for the College Board. They found that the College Board’s Practice SAT, given to 10th-graders, aligned better with the high school Colorado Academic Standards, a requirement of 2015 legislation, said Will Morton, director of assessment administration for the CDE.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sal Khan, founder and president of Khan Academy was also interviewed for the article. &lt;span&gt;“This SAT is is frankly so much easier, so much closer to what students are seeing in their classes,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorado is one of nine states – along with Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island – and the District of Columbia that will administer the SAT this year at no cost to all public school juniors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full article &quot;&lt;span&gt;Colorado juniors face new, revamped college exam in SAT after state dumps rival ACT&quot;&lt;/span&gt; here.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.denverpost.com/2017/03/06/colorado-juniors-sat-college-exam/&quot;&gt;http://www.denverpost.com/2017/03/06/colorado-juniors-sat-college-exam/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Colorado juniors gear up to take the SAT this spring&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
