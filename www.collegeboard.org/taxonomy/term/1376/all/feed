&lt;p&gt;Governor Jerry Brown has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=19559&quot;&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; into law &lt;a href=&quot;http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1985&quot;&gt;AB1985&lt;/a&gt;, legislation introduced by Assembly member Das Williams that requires California Community Colleges to develop and adopt a uniform policy of awarding general education course credits for Advanced Placement exam scores of 3 or higher. While the California State University System (made up of 23 campuses) has a uniform policy of awarding credit for AP scores of 3 and higher, the California Community College System of 113 colleges lacks a system-wide approach. Each California Community College has its own individual AP credit policy — for example, 24 community colleges require scores of 4 for credit, six community colleges require a score of 5 for credit, and 10 community colleges have no AP credit policies at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the bill signing, Scott Hill, vice president, College Board Western Regional Office said: “This is a tremendous victory for California students, families and educators. With AB1985 signed into law, California now will have a statewide Advanced Placement credit policy ensuring that students at community colleges receive the credits they earned as a result of their hard work in AP. At a time when AP participation and performance has increased significantly in the state, this law provides more students with a greater opportunity to graduate college on time and save money. The College Board is grateful for the leadership of Assembly member Williams, who authored the bill, and Governor Brown for signing the bill into law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 19, at an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/academic/california-ap-students-and-educators-fight-uniform-ap-credit-policy&quot;&gt;Assembly Higher Education Committee hearing&lt;/a&gt;, educators and students lined up to testify in support of AB1985. Rachel Lewis, an AP English teacher,  told the Committee members how students every year who did well on the AP English exam would come back to tell her  how well prepared they felt for the English curriculum of their community colleges, state colleges, and private colleges. “I want my students to benefit from the full fruit of their labors and know their efforts are recognized and meaningful. When not awarded college credit, students who look at the AP test as a financial investment into their future are punished for their thoughtful planning. It is especially unfair to students who are already struggling to pay for college and are now essentially asked to pay for the same class twice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law has support from the higher education community:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Said Frank Chong, Ed. D., president of Santa Rosa Junior College: “This new law will have a positive impact for our community. A uniform AP credit policy benefits students and parents planning for college and tuition affordability. Students won’t need to retake introductory courses in subjects where they’ve already demonstrated academic proficiency, propelling them more quickly to completion.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Said Eric Forbes, assistant vice chancellor, Academic Affairs/Student Academic Support, at California State University:  “CSU will work with our California community college partners to ensure that AP-course credits are also identified uniformly when students transfer to the CSU. Removing transfer pathway barriers is a benefit for students and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California is one of 20 states to have a statewide or system-wide uniform AP credit policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;California Adopts Uniform AP Credit Policy for Community Colleges&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Melanie Stambaugh, which requires the state’s public college and university system to establish a uniform policy of awarding college credit for Advanced Placement (AP) Exam scores of 3 or higher. Under current law, each institution is allowed to develop its own requirements for awarding credit, and some schools require higher scores than others. The new law takes effect this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.teachwithtvw.org/capitol-classroom/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Capitol Classroom&lt;/a&gt; who championed the bill throughout the legislative process were invited to witness the governor’s signing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The College Board thanks Washington officials and educators for their leadership in helping to ensure that students have the opportunity to receive the credits they’ve earned. Washington is the 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; state to enact a system-wide uniform AP credit policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Washington Establishes Statewide AP Credit Policy&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;“Many times in the rural areas, we don’t have access to resources that other more urban and suburban areas have. This is an opportunity to help our rural schools,” said Pratt. “The biggest thing is that 20 hours practice has been linked to a 115-point increase on the SAT, which is a big dramatic jump that could benefit our students in rural communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superintendents from rural and small California districts can sign up for the Challenge by August 15 at &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/OSPRuralChallenge&quot;&gt;http://bit.ly/OSPRuralChallenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Bringing Official SAT Practice to Rural and Small Towns&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I’m delighted to be at Forum this year because this is my region, the WRO, and the opportunity to network and meet with some of the members that are the schools that help serve.  For example, I’m thrilled that Steve Fisk from North Central High School in Spokane, which is one of our school that does the school day SAT, Springboard and Capstone, is here presenting and talking about how they have shifted the mindset in this highly impoverished school to one where all students get the opportunity to experience the joy that is AP and some of the other opportunities to propel them to college success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What session are you most interesting in attending?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They all are so good!  I’m excited that Kelly Stromberg, a teacher at North central, is talking about Capstone because it’s such an exciting program, which provides kids a rigorous opportunity to learn about the things that are important not just for college but for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is one thing that you’ve learned so far?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was delighted to listen to both David Coleman and Sal Kahn talk about the work we are doing in terms of our partnership.  Davdid Coleman is an incredible speaker, and I learned about where the word “freedom” came from!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will you take what you&#039;ve learned at Forum and use it in your day to day work at the College Board?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m excited about attending sessions that talk about propelling students, especially underrepresented students, especially African-American students, into Advance Placement, so I’m really excited to learn about some of the things that other school districts have been using in order to connect kids to AP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Overheard at Forum: Nancy Potter, Director of State and District Partnerships and K12, Western Regional Office of the College Board&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;BASIS.ed began in 1998 when founders Michael and Olga Block started their first charter school. That school, BASIS Tucson, began in a small rented space with 56 students. Today, BASIS.ed serves 7,500 students in 17 schools, both charter and independent schools, in five states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two days, we were able to sit in classrooms, engage with students, and learn more about what makes BASIS students so special. Here are just a few things that we learned from these students during our time at BASIS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A love of learning starts early; and it starts with teachers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A constant refrain from BASIS students was the importance of having passionate, excited teachers to help them connect to the material. “The teacher needs to bring something beyond the textbook,” said one BASIS Tucson North student. Every student could name at least one teacher who had an immeasurable impact on their educational experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BASIS teachers typically have their academic degrees in the fields that they teach, which allows them to use their content expertise to drive learning. It’s not unusual to see a teacher with a Ph.D. in biology teaching 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; graders the scientific method or a teacher with a Ph.D. in world history reviewing medieval history with a class of 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; graders. Many students credited their love of learning with this early access to content experts.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Placement courses and exams aren’t obstacles, they’re opportunities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BASIS offers a highly rigorous academic program for its students, with its upper schools using Advanced Placement courses and exams to gauge student performance. All BASIS students are required to take six AP exams by the time they graduate, though this number ends up sounding low after talking to many juniors and seniors—most students average about 10 AP exams during their time at BASIS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One might think so many AP courses and exams present an obstacle for BASIS students. On the contrary, students take on the challenge of AP exams as opportunities to show off what they know and what they learned over the year. “The AP exams are my Olympics,” one BASIS student said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BASIS schools celebrate AP Exam time, providing extra time for exam review and encouraging students to do their best on the exam. At BASIS Tucson North, students receive a rousing send-off akin to a football pep rally for every AP exam they take. One by one, each AP exam taker’s name is called and the student runs through a human tunnel made up of BASIS students down the hallway to the tune of “Eye of the Tiger.” What better way to get psyched for the exam?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to college planning resources early and often has a big impact.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each BASIS school has a college counselor who works with each senior to help guide them through the college planning process. The college counselor works with all students, but the work begins in earnest during senior year when each BASIS student must take a college counseling class. In addition to the course, seniors meet individually with the college counselor once a week until they’ve completed the college application process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using college planning resources like &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;Big Future&lt;/a&gt;, students begin by creating a college list of 10 schools: two “reach” schools, six “target” schools, and two “safety” schools. From there, students work in their college counseling class to determine what schools they will apply to, complete applications, and explore financial aid and scholarship opportunities. The introduction of college planning early on to students in combination with the personal attention during their senior year has enabled BASIS students to smoothly navigate the college planning process.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social media is integral to students’ lives – both academically and personally.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Social media isn’t just for fun, it helps students tackle homework, study for exams, and stave off procrastination and senioritis. Several BASIS students said they found themselves spending too much time on Tumblr, but also cited &lt;a href=&quot;https://brightreads.com/the-rise-of-studyblrs-8916998179f9#.g5jj95nww&quot;&gt;Studyblrs&lt;/a&gt; – Tumblr blogs that share study methods, study playlists, exam prep, and more – as spurring them back into schoolwork instead of killing time on the social networking site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other BASIS students noted that they often used Facebook to help them get through school. For example, many students at BASIS Scottsdale use Facebook groups for their courses to help study for exams and offer encouragement for other students. One student said that if he was studying late at night and couldn’t decipher a history topic or a math equation, he could post in the Facebook group and have a response within minutes. These groups are often handed down from class to class as BASIS students graduate and move on. Who says social media doesn’t have academic value?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being involved inside and outside the classroom is important.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking an average of 10 AP classes during your high school career is a big undertaking in and of itself. However, BASIS students are active beyond their classroom. As seniors, BASIS students complete senior projects. These projects allow students to spend their final semester applying what they have learned in an independent study project, working with a mentor in the field to go in-depth into a topic. These projects range from working in a university biomedical engineering lab to taking on an internship to conducting field work in criminal psychology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, BASIS students are active in plenty of extracurriculars, including sports, volunteering, the arts, and more. They’re your typical teens and want to explore as much as they can during their high school years.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practicing hard pays off.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results of this hard work speaks for itself. In 2013, BASIS students had an average score of 3.6 on AP Exams, and BASIS students passed 84% of the exams they took. That year, there were 148 AP Scholars, 95 Scholars with Honors, 263 Scholars with Distinction, and 78 National AP Scholars among BASIS students. Many BASIS schools can boast that 100% of their graduates have gone on to 4 years institutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the hard work of these students in and out of the classroom, the students we talked to are headed to some of the finest college and universities in the country, many with scholarships and financial aid to support their attendance. In addition, many students planned to continue the research they conducted during their senior projects with faculty members in the fall, an exciting next step in their educational journey.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Six Lessons We Learned From Spending Two Days with BASIS Students&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Christopher P. Chatmon, executive director of the office, serves on the College Board’s College Planning Advisory Committee where he supports the College Board’s work to provide guidance to students on their road to college.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared in &lt;/em&gt;The New York Times&lt;em&gt; on January 4, 2016. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/education/edlife/in-oakland-building-boys-into-men.html?ref=edlife&amp;amp;_r=3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; to read the original article.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Jennings begins his class on cultural identity for African-American boys with a daily affirmation: “I am focused. I am ready to learn. Let’s turn up!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subject is how society sees black men, and the lens is the Matrix, a metaphor borrowed from the sci-fi film. Students identify the negative cultural stereotypes and expectations for black men and boys — what the Matrix wants you to think — that wreak havoc on a youngster’s self-image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Matrix is there to mess you up,” Rahsaan Smith, a live wire of a 13-year-old, pipes in. “It’s a very, very dark world, but you can’t be afraid to be a source of light.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jennings’s class, at the Montera Middle School in Oakland, Calif., is part of a novel and ambitious initiative by the Oakland Unified School District to rewrite the pernicious script of racial inequality, underachievement and lack of opportunity for African-American boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full-credit elective, “Mastering Our Cultural Identity: African American Male Image” (commonly referred to as the Manhood Development Program), is now in the daily curriculum at 20 schools throughout the district, tailored to age appropriateness for third to 12th graders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While lower grades focus on the stories, legacies and images of black people, high school students take a deep dive into African-American history and culture, from ancient civilizations to the civil rights movement to contemporary media. All classes are taught by black male instructors whose own experiences and perspectives provide a multidimensional understanding of the students they mentor (in Oakland, as elsewhere, more than half the teachers are white and most are women).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manhood Development is the flagship program of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ousd.org/page/495?q=5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Office of African American Male Achievement&lt;/a&gt;, the country’s first department within a public school district that specifically addresses the needs of its most vulnerable children: black boys, who have stubbornly remained at the bottom of nearly every academic indicator, including high school graduation rates in most states, according to the Schott Foundation for Public Education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begun unofficially five years ago, the office kicked into high gear in 2012. That is when the district signed an agreement with the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights to improve outcomes following an investigation into grossly disproportionate suspension rates of black males — 42 percent annually, though they made up only 17 percent of the school population. A majority were for “willful defiance,” nonviolent infractions like texting in class or using profanity with a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When black children do what children do, the system reacts more harshly,” said Christopher P. Chatmon, the executive director of the Office of African American Male Achievement and its turbo-powered guiding force. “The No. 1 strategy to reduce discipline issues is engaged instruction.” In Manhood Development, he added, “we’re talking about how to elevate their game academically through the lens of brotherhood.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a city with a legacy of black political activism — where the unarmed Oscar Grant was fatally shot by a police officer in 2009 at the Fruitvale BART station and #blacklivesmatter was germinated — the initiative begins with the premise that the words “black male” and “achievement” go together and that a college degree can be a part of their future. The philosophy might be encapsulated in a greeting scribbled on a whiteboard at Oakland High School: “Welcome Kings!” — the somewhat grandiose title a shorthand for holding oneself to a high standard and being responsible for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it as #blackmindsmatter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission of the Office of African American Male Achievement is to support all of Oakland’s black male students, which it strives to do through a variety of initiatives, including peer mentoring, a student leadership council and conferences that bring together role models and students — a sort of uber school assembly that has the cacophonous energy of a revivalist meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, two Afrocentric core courses have just been introduced — in English language arts and history — that meet the strict prerequisites for the University of California. And a career academy is in the works at Oakland High called the Khepera Pathway, which will steep African-American male students in entrepreneurship, social innovation and civic engagement, with help from a $750,000 grant from Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the programs are too young to be assessed, in the last two years chronic absenteeism and suspensions have dropped for black males in the district (come July, defiance will no longer be a suspension infraction). Last year, more than half the 52 students who started Manhood Development classes as freshmen — the first graduating class — headed off to college with scholarships from the local nonprofit East Bay College Fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most encouraging is the African American Male Achievement’s honor roll for black students, male and female, with grade-point averages of 3.0 or above — an accomplishment celebrated every year at a raucous event attended by thousands at a gospel church. The percentage of young men on the roll has risen from 16 percent to 25 percent over the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each school day, Rahsaan Smith travels the city’s vast economic, social and psychic divide, leaving the flatlands of East Oakland, synonymous with violence, for a middle school perched on a steep hill fragrant with eucalyptus. He is one of the few boys in Mr. Jennings’s class with both a dad and a mom at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to a white child born in the Oakland Hills, a black child born in East Oakland is 21 times as likely to be poor and a third as likely to be reading at grade level in the fourth grade, according to the Alameda County Public Health Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a survey of 250 boys in Manhood Development classes, Vajra Watson, director of research and policy for equity at the University of California, Davis, found that half of middle school students had seen someone shot; by 10th grade, two-thirds had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than anything, it is the deep relationships between instructors and students, many of whom grow up with no male figure at home, that hold the key to ending the soul-numbing disenfranchisement that so many young men experience at school. Teachers will often stop by to ask Manhood Development instructors for insights about particular students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to have your hand on their pulse,” said Earnest Jenkins III, who teaches the class at Oakland High, one of the city’s most diverse schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jenkins has seen it all — “crack epidemic grandbabies,” homeless students, the student who sells snacks at school as the family’s only breadwinner, “the parent who tells her son to go out and sell this weed to pay the bills.” And worst of all, “the trauma that nobody cares.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to erase eight or nine years of low or no expectations,” Mr. Jenkins said. “You have to make them un-believe what they’ve been taught to believe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shawn A. Ginwright, a professor of education in the Africana studies department at San Francisco State University, noted that in cities like Oakland, “what shows up in the classroom is often the disinvestment outside of it.” Profound, meaningful relationships with teachers “help students develop a sense of agency,” he said. “Young people are not going to school just to accumulate skill sets but also to broaden the vision for their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That vision was nonexistent when Mr. Chatmon was in elementary school in South San Francisco in the early 1970s. The teachers “didn’t know what to do with my spirited energy,” he recalled. In third grade, he was deemed so disruptive that the teacher moved his desk into the coat closet for two months, frequently shutting the door. In high school, he was told he “didn’t have what it takes to get into college” (he attended San Francisco State) and probably wouldn’t graduate (he would go on to earn a master’s degree in education from Brown).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He vowed that, one day, he would be the best teacher ever to boys like himself rather than being “undercut, demeaned and made to feel not smart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Chatmon’s background includes a stint as the principal of an alternative high school for formerly incarcerated and truant youth. The father of three sons, he radiates a sense of urgency beneath his signature Kangol caps. “Our role is not to say, ‘I caught you,’” he said. “It’s to ask, ‘What is our moral imperative and how does it show up in the education of our children?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamar Hancock, an instructor at Oakland Technical, the city’s highest-ranking public high school, tries to retrieve the spark hidden within recalcitrant young men. “I see students with passion burning in their brains whose parents are not academic,” he said. “They’re looking for some kind of influence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stands outside the door of Room 141, shaking hands with each student as he enters class — a soft handshake or a lack of eye contact is a tip-off to something awry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some teachers don’t take you seriously when you raise your hand,” said Morris Jackson, a junior who is active in the Black Student Union and tutors at a local elementary school. “They think you’re just another ghetto black.” Not so in Mr. Hancock’s class. “What drew me was the unity of African-American men,” Morris said. “When we disagree, we disagree respectfully. Coming to this class makes you want to stay and do better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent class discussion ricocheted from Marcus Garvey to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., James Brown and X-Men comics and a vocabulary lesson set to a jazz standard by Wayne Shorter. On “business excellence Thursdays,” students dress the part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manhood Development students are typically an academic mix, including high achievers and those needing extra help. Some sign up for a class year after year; some move on and then come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rickey Jackson, now a senior, almost failed his freshman year, burrowing into the school basement instead of attending class. At the time, his mother was in and out of the hospital with cancer. “I gave up, so to speak,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rickey and his siblings lived on their own, and when their mother died at age 57, Rickey called Mr. Hancock, who helped him make up nearly a year of school. He now has a 3.6 G.P.A. and recently went on an airplane for the first time to visit colleges. So far, he has gotten into six Historically Black Colleges and Universities, which reviewed his transcripts at a college fair and rendered an on-site decision. “My goal for Rickey was to hear the words ‘I got accepted,’ ” Mr. Hancock said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manhood Development strives to create a scaffold of resilience with a flotilla of black male professionals and college advisers who mentor high school students. It also organizes field trips to local colleges and universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a week, fellows with the U.C. Berkeley Destination College Advising Corps advise the classes. A recent session for Mr. Hancock’s juniors and seniors took creative license with “Jeopardy!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One category: “Myths About Blacks in Education.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For $100: “There are more black men where than in prison?” Answer: College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work to elevate young African-American males is being done not just in Oakland but also in cities around the country. The Minneapolis Public Schools recently established its own Office of Black Male Student Achievement with a curriculum developed with the University of Minnesota. Last year, New York City, the nation’s largest public school system, announced plans to hire 1,000 black, Latino and Asian male teachers (black men make up just 2 percent of the nation’s teaching force).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most heralded models are all-boys schools. Among them: Urban Prep Academies, a Chicago charter school with an all-black student body that famously boasts a 100 percent college acceptance rate. The school day on its three campuses runs from 8:30 to 4:30, not counting time for required extracurriculars, and students wear jackets and ties. (It’s not for everyone: The school loses about a third of enrollees.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District of Columbia Public Schools is working with Urban Prep’s founder and C.E.O., Tim King, to develop a similar all-boys school as part of its $20 million Empowering Males of Color initiative. As in Oakland, the “secret sauce” is high expectations and paying close attention, Mr. King said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While admiring these efforts, some educators see potential pitfalls. “They’ve done a lot to boost the self-esteem of these kids,” said Pedro Noguera, a professor of education at the University of California, Los Angeles. But he added: “What you don’t want is for the other teachers to say, ‘I don’t have to worry about these students because the other instructor is taking care of it.’” Dr. Noguera would like to see a rigorous evaluation of the program. Understanding components that seem to be working would be beneficial to other districts grappling with equity issues, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being embedded in a district also means students may still encounter what some researchers call “the soft bigotry of low expectations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There has to be a focus on the cultural competence of white female teachers who work with black boys,” said Shaun R. Harper, a professor in the Graduate School of Education at the University of Pennsylvania. “There’s not enough focus on, dare I say, remediating schoolteachers to effectively teach diverse students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Shawn Dove, head of the Campaign for Black Male Achievement, a national leadership network, the new programs are a result of America’s unfinished business, centuries old. “When you start to shift the culture, climate and language of an entire school district, you begin seeing changes,” he said. “But it takes time. It’s not Jack-in-the-beanstalk work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Montera Middle School, Mr. Jennings encourages his students to set goals for themselves, whether it’s straight A’s or simply handing in their assignments on time. He frequently tells his students that “success is addicting” and enjoins them: “Speak loud and proud!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He writes their names on the board when they do something positive, instead of the other way around. He watches his young charges change “not just academically, but their character — what they believe about themselves and what they want people to know about them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony Johnson, an Oakland Tech senior, recently won the Confidence Award at a national event for black men in Louisville, Ky. His goal is to be a pediatric nurse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is proof that what they teach us is not a myth,” he said. “We are the ones who are going to set the bar.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Members in the News: In Oakland, Building Boys Into Men&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Arroyo Valley High School is one of four schools nationwide to receive the Gaston Caperton Opportunity Award in 2015, which recognizes schools and districts that create opportunities for traditionally underrepresented students. Arroyo Valley, with a student body of 95 percent underrepresented minorities, has not only increased AP participation by 13 percent since 2011, but also boasts a 95 percent graduation rate — a remarkable increase of 18 percent in the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the ceremony, Peter Hidalgo, who teaches AP US History, told his students that by challenging themselves, taking AP classes, graduating from high school and going to college, “your efforts will change the lives of your children and their children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arroyo Valley High School’s strategy for success can be summarized in one word: hope. The school has taken the mission statement for San Bernardino City Unified District to heart; it takes a collaborative effort from the staff and community to ensure that all students develop the knowledge, skills, and proficiencies required for college, career, civic, and economic success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One AP student who spoke at the ceremony had wise words for his fellow students. “AP wants you to dream and rise like the hawk that you are,” said Ixayac Cortes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a beautiful performance by the school’s dance company, the students celebrated the fact that they have had to overcome many obstacles to succeed in school.  The San Bernardino City Unified District Superintendent Dr. Dale Marsden congratulated students for their incredible work and gave them some words of advice: “Don’t let anything distract you from what you want.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, 60 percent of Arroyo Valley High School graduates enroll in a two-year college, and 35 percent go to a four-year college. And one thing is certain: all students graduate with the support of a school that taught them the real power of hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Arroyo Valley High School Celebrates the Power of Hope&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Fresno Unified, the largest school district in the Central Valley, has taken an “all-in approach” to preparing its students for success after high school. To ensure that all juniors have the opportunity to benefit from the SAT, the district is administering the college entrance exam at every one of its high schools on Tuesday, April 12. Students will take the SAT during the school day for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Shott, a local continuation high school student who is participating in this year’s SAT School Day administration, told reporter Juanita Stevenson, “The fact that Fresno Unified is letting this continuation school take the SAT for the first time — it shows that they haven’t really given up on us yet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help these students feel confident walking into the test, the district has also partnered with the College Board, Khan Academy, and the Boys and Girls Club to offer free online tutoring. Students have been busy preparing with Khan Academy’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;free practice tools&lt;/a&gt; during the school day and then seamlessly continuing their practice after school at three local Boys and Girls Clubs. Thanks to a donation of 94 computers to these Clubs, even students who do not have a computer or access to the internet at home have the chance to practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s about access, and giving all kids a fair shake,” Superintendent Mike Hansen told Juanita Stevenson. He hopes that that this approach of removing barriers will encourage Fresno Unified students to take advantage of the opportunity to succeed. “We want them to know — as a superintendent, as a board, as principals, teachers, educators, as a community — we believe in you, we know you can do it. It’s sitting right in front of you. Come do it. Write your own ticket.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California AP Students and Educators Fight for a Uniform AP Credit Policy</title>

While the California State University System (made up of 23 campuses) has a uniform policy of awarding credit for AP scores of 3 and higher, the California Community College System of 113 colleges lacks a system-wide approach. Each California Community College has its own individual AP credit policy — for example, 24 community colleges require scores of 4 for credit, 6 community colleges require a score of 5 for credit, and 10 community colleges have no AP credit policies at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 19, at the Assembly Higher Education Committee hearing at the California State Capitol, educators and students lined up to support of AB1985, a bill introduced by Assembly member Das Williams (D-Santa Barbara) that  would require California Community Colleges to develop and adopt a uniform policy of awarding general education course credits for AP exam scores of 3 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While all the University of California and California State University will accept a 3 for credit, in community colleges that is not the case,” explained Assembly member Williams at the hearing. “We find this to be a bait and switch for our students who are doing the hard work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rachel Lewis, an AP English teacher from Western Sierra Collegiate Academy in Rocklin, CA, testified in support of the bill. Her high school has had an inclusive AP program for the past 3 years, and every single junior takes AP English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Lewis told the Committee members how students every year who did well on the AP English exam would come back to tell her  how well prepared they felt for the English curriculum of their community colleges, state colleges, and private colleges. “I want my students to benefit from the full fruit of their labors and know their efforts are recognized and meaningful,” she said.  When not awarded college credit, she continued, “students who look at the AP test as a financial investment into their future are punished for their thoughtful planning. It is especially unfair to students who are already struggling to pay for college and are now essentially asked to pay for the same class twice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her powerful testimony was followed by the testimony of Western Sierra Collegiate Academy AP Literature and AP History student Hannah Blackmore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-income students, Blackmore explained, “usually turn to community colleges and  the AP system as our last hope to getting a college.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the testimonies, more students, educators, and civil justice advocates lined up in front of a microphone to express additional support for the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pam Kerouac, Senior Director of AP Higher Ed Policy at the College Board, who deferred her testimony to an AP teacher and student, said she was inspired by what she witnessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Watching restless legislators, after a long day, stop fidgeting and listen to each student was spectacular,” Ms. Kerouac said. “It was obvious they were not willing to stand by and let the inconsistent AP credit policy toss-up game continue affecting who gets college credit and who does not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill was passed unanimously out of the Assembly Higher Education Committee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We swept the vote count 13-0 in support,” said Ken Woods, Executive Director of Higher Education in California for the College Board, who also deferred his testimony at the hearing. “I have always been proud of working for the College Board, but in my 20 plus years, this was the highlight — we accomplished something that will impact so many students in California.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After clearing the Assembly, the bill will be heard in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no one better to speak truth to power than classroom teachers and their students,” said Julie Harris-Lawrence, said Executive Director of Teacher Outreach and Advocacy for the College Board. &quot;We look forward to bringing the voices of AP educators and students to the California State Senate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;California AP Students and Educators Fight for a Uniform AP Credit Policy&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deb Thyng Schmidt: &lt;/strong&gt;Longmont High School’s Arriba FAFSA Family Night is a pilot program that takes advantage of the new early availability of the FAFSA. A workshop to get parents to complete the FAFSA at an earlier stage in the process removes a major barrier for our Hispanic students. Financial aid officers from Colorado State University (CSU), including Spanish speakers, lead parents through the process of completing the 2017-18 FAFSA online using Longmont High Chromebooks. To make it possible for more of our parents to attend, we offer childcare through our Arriba student organization and a meal through a local restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: What are the top three goals for the event?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DTS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build on our relationships with parents and work with them on what can be a very intimidating part of the college application process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raise parents’ sights for their students by telling them how financial aid can make college affordable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure that our Hispanic students have a Student Aid Report in hand as they enter the college application process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Biedscheid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be proactive in our work with students and families every chance we get. Help families avoid mistakes on the FAFSA to speed up the process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amplify our efforts to create clear pathways to higher education by coming together. While Longmont High School works to develop relationships with parents, CSU’s Office of Financial Aid works to develop relationships with high school counselors and administrators.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Show, firsthand, how financial aid can eliminate the barrier of the cost of higher education.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: Tell us how this partnership between Longmont High School and CSU came about. What are the benefits of a partnership between K–12 and higher education institutions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DTS: &lt;/strong&gt;Because I was a former writer and consultant for the College Board and familiar with ther programs and services, I expected to find useful resources about the new FAFSA timeline on their website, and I did. I contacted Anne Sturtevant, executive director of higher education at the College Board, and asked if she could recommend staff to help with our FAFSA Night. My request was extended to Tom, and I was delighted that he was enthusiastic about joining us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many benefits of this type of partnership, too many to list. But a major benefit is that parents and students always come away inspired — and their sights raised — by positive exposure to the people who represent higher education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, when students see this type of collaboration, they become more comfortable with the experience they’ll have after high school. College is seen as a natural extension of their intellectual and personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TB: &lt;/strong&gt;The College Board is uniquely positioned to bring K–12 and higher education together in a way that shows how much more effective we can be when we work together. My experience attending College Board events has honestly spilled over into my day-to-day work and is constantly at the top of my mind. When Anne and Deborah reached out to ask me to contribute to Longmont High School’s event, my response was an automatic “yes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: Why is it important to hold an event like this now? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DTS&lt;/strong&gt;: The change to the FAFSA calendar provides the ideal opportunity to get information out to parents in a new way, at an earlier time in the process. We’re always looking for ways to build relationships with parents and students, and the timing is perfect this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TB&lt;/strong&gt;: The early FAFSA adds months to the college and financial aid application process. It gives students much more time to choose an institution that’s the best fit. Creating an earlier opportunity for underrepresented students to leverage the FAFSA change is the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: What are the top five things you hope students and parents take away from this event?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DTS and TB: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The FAFSA may seem intimidating, but it can be completed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The FAFSA is a crucial first step to enable students to afford college. It’s the primary document for eligibility for need-based and scholarship aid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Concerns about affording college shouldn’t keep students from applying. There’s assistance out there and a process for making college possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Colleges and universities like CSU have staff members ready and willing to share their expertise so that students and their families can afford college.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High schools like Longmont have staff members ready and willing to encourage students to explore postsecondary education and make it happen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Members Host “Arriba FAFSA Family Night” in Colorado&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
