&lt;p&gt;The theft of unpublished test content is a serious criminal matter. The College Board and our partner ETS are responding quickly and deliberately to investigate and resolve this matter. To be clear, this stolen content has not been administered to students as part of a domestic or international test date. Therefore, no students have or will be impacted by this theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the investigation is ongoing, we are limited in what we can share. We want to assure you, our members, that we are taking the stolen test content off the SAT administration schedule while the investigation is under way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will continue to update our members on the progress of the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;A note to our members in response to Aug. 3 Reuters article&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Supt. Hanson is a long-time friend and partner of the College Board and has transformed the district into a model of excellence and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supt. Hanson has led California’s fourth largest school district for the last 12 years, overseeing more than 74,000 students and 130 campuses. Throughout his tenure, he has driven remarkable change, doubling the percentage of students who graduate prepared to enter California’s public university system. He has also doubled the number of students taking Advanced Placement classes, ensuring that all students can take advantage of rigorous coursework and the opportunities they’ve earned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under his leadership, Fresno USD has also forged a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/academic/fresno-unified-school-district-removes-barriers-success&quot;&gt;remarkable partnership&lt;/a&gt; with Khan Academy, Boys and Girls Club and College Board to provide comprehensive practice support for students preparing for the SAT. The partnership inspired a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/counseling-admissions-academic/three-students-show-power-productive-practice&quot;&gt;national campaign&lt;/a&gt; between the College Board and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cgcs.org/&quot;&gt;Council of Great City Schools&lt;/a&gt;, announced this October, to challenge the nation’s largest school districts to take similarly bold steps to help clear a path for students to succeed.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mike has been a nationally recognized leader for the tremendous work he has done in Fresno,” said Todd Huston, College Board’s Senior Vice President for State and District Partnerships. “It has been a privilege for us to work closely with him and we are deeply committed to ensuring the great work in Fresno continues to honor Mike’s vision and our shared commitment to the students in Fresno.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supt. Hanson has shown what is possible in American education. And while his visions are bold, he has remained attentive to what he calls the “small spaces” in education – the individual students, classrooms and teachers. The course he has charted for the Fresno community is bright and full of hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mike is a leader of uncommon courage and integrity. His devotion to Fresno students for more than a decade shines as a national example, and his achievements speak for themselves,” said David Coleman, College Board President and CEO. “I am excited to see what Mike will turn his talents and passion to next.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The College Board thanks Supt. Hanson for his leadership, vision and partnership and wishes him all the best. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Mike Hanson Announces He Will Step Down as Fresno Superintendent&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The College Board and our members are committed to delivering opportunity for every young person globally, no matter where they live or what their faith. One way we can secure this mission is to help colleges find and reach students who have aspirations for higher education. Both domestic and international colleges recruit students by partnering with the College Board to find and engage academically qualified students who have given their permission. As long as the recent executive order on immigration is in effect, the College Board will enable participating international colleges to connect for free through our Student Search Service with students from the seven affected countries and refugee families. Given that the path to studying in the United States may be blocked for some time, it is our duty to ensure these students have a wide set of opportunities for higher education.  The College Board will also make a contribution to the International Rescue Committee to fund a college counselor to provide free advice to affected students and families so they can make the best college choices possible. Our mission calls us to do what we can to ensure that all students, everywhere, take the opportunities they have earned.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;A note to our members: Our response to the executive order on immigration&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;In September, the College Board, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;acknowledging the problem, began phasing in a new version of its Accuplacer. The redesigned, adaptive test groups questions in more clearly identifiable pathways, hoping to make it easier for college advisers to match skill level with planned field of study.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new measures, which will be implemented in close partnership with the College Board’s members, constitute the most robust and direct actions taken by a college entrance exam provider against test takers seeking an unfair advantage on the test and companies and actors who assist them for their own profit or benefit. While the growing influence of organizations that steal and sell test content to students has been concentrated in a few international locations in recent years, the solutions to preserve the integrity of SAT scores must be implemented globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of the new SAT last year, the College Board has increased test form development to reduce reuse, strengthened prevention and detection techniques, and bolstered efforts to identify and pursue those sharing copyright-protected test content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are unwavering in our commitment to SAT test security and we will continue to confront any efforts to undermine it, including the unauthorized disclosure of test questions and test forms,” said Peter Schwartz, Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel at the College Board. “There are three fundamental ways we protect the value of the SAT for test takers and score recipients: increasing the pool of test items, increasing security and deterrence, and limiting exposure of test materials by reducing the number of administrations. In all of our efforts, we’ve worked to strike a balance between thwarting those seeking an unfair advantage and providing testing opportunities for the vast majority of students who play by the rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New measures announced today further increase security and preserve the integrity of SAT scores. They include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reducing the international testing dates for the SAT to four for the 2017-18 and 2018-19 school years, with administrations in October, December, March, and May. Recognizing that international students use both the SAT and SAT Subject Tests to build competitive applications, SAT Subject Tests will be available in October, November, December, May, and June.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Canceling the June 2017 international SAT administration, as part of the change to the international test administration schedule. SAT Subject Tests will be available during the June 2017 administration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Providing the names of test prep companies and individuals we suspect of stealing and receiving secure test content to law enforcement and other government agencies in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prohibiting individuals from taking the SAT, SAT Subject Tests, and Advanced Placement Exams when we conclude they have gained or attempted to gain or share an unfair advantage on any College Board test.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exploring with both colleges and high schools effective ways to share with them – consistent with applicable laws and contractual obligations – whether their applicants or attending students, respectively, have gained or attempted to gain or share an unfair advantage on any College Board test.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increasing test center audits worldwide.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Making it easier for students and educators to confidentially and anonymously report suspected cheating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expanding the College Board&#039;s criteria for barring registrants who are taking the SAT for other than one of its intended purposes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With these new policies, the College Board is committed to expose and thwart individuals and organizations who attempt to steal and share test materials for profit or other gain,” said Jeremiah Quinlan, Dean of Undergraduate Admissions at Yale University. “My colleagues and I will continue to seek further means to protect the integrity of test administrations so that honest test-takers throughout the world can freely pursue their educational aspirations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The College Board has been very mindful of the dual obligations to both confront bad actors and to ensure that students who play by the rules can pursue their lifelong dreams,” said Zina L. Evans, Vice President for Enrollment Management at the University of Florida. “This firm stance sends a clear signal that individuals or organizations attempting to steal and share test materials for their own profit and benefit will not be tolerated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The College Board is taking new, bold action at the urging of our Board of Trustees and in consultation with colleagues in higher education,” said James Montoya, Chief of Membership, Governance, and Global Higher Education at the College Board. “We will continue to consult with educators and will take great care in implementing these actions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policies will be enacted for future administrations. The College Board will provide more details to test takers and educators later this spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a comprehensive investigation and statistical analysis, the College Board also informed a number of students who sat for the January international SAT administration that their scores are being canceled. The scores for an additional set of students are being reviewed as part of ongoing comprehensive investigations. These actions are part of the standard process of ensuring the integrity of each SAT administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new policies announced today build on enhanced security measures the College Board has implemented over the past few years, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased security of test materials prior to and during an exam administration, including delivery and storage procedures, rules for access, and the implementation of secure lockboxes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comprehensive test-day administration protocols including sign-in and photo ID requirements, limiting testing room access, protocols for seating, and procedures for monitoring examinee behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rigorous and innovative statistical analyses to identify invalid scores.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The College Board’s latest innovative approach to address attempts to gain an unfair advantage will help in reflecting students’ real academic standing and achievements when considering their application,” said Cesar Wazen, Director of Scholarships &amp;amp; Partnerships Office, Qatar University. “We thank College Board leadership for standing up for colleges, aspiring students, and their families around the world.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College Board Announces New Measures to Enhance SAT Security Domestically and Abroad&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Students also complete a questionnaire, which include a series of optional questions. For instance, students can provide their race or ethnicity, and by doing so, help the College Board evaluate the fairness of the test and ensure that it is fair and accurate for all students. By sharing their course preference and potential college major, counselors and college admission officers can help students make plans for the future. Students can indicate if they come from a military family in order to be connected to unique information and resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we make clear to students, they don’t have to respond to these and other optional questions, but we recommend they do because it helps us and our members best deliver programs and opportunities to serve students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are in constant dialogue with students, parents, educators, and state and district partners in order to evaluate our policies and procedures. As a result of this engagement, we regularly enhance student privacy. For example, just recently, we announced:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will no longer collect Social Security numbers from students who participate in our assessment and instruction programs. (Effective August 2018)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The question about religious preference or affiliation on the questionnaire will change from &quot;Indicate your religious preference or affiliation&quot; to &quot;Are you interested in religious colleges or religiously affiliated campus clubs/activities? If yes, select a religion below.&quot; (Effective August 2017)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The College Board has a deep respect for student privacy, and we are committed to protecting it. We are a signatory, with more than 200 K-12 school service providers and education leaders, of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://studentprivacypledge.org/privacy-pledge/&quot;&gt;Pledge to Safeguard Student Privacy&lt;/a&gt;, a public commitment for the responsible collection and use of student data. You can learn more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/privacy-policy&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, including about the principles that ensure our commitment to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, here are answers to some questions we frequently receive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Does the College Board sell student data? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The College Board does not sell student data. Through Student Search Service, students may participate in a voluntary program that connects students with information about educational and financial aid opportunities from nearly 1700 colleges, universities, scholarship programs and educational organizations. When students take the SAT, PSAT/NMSQT and PSAT 10, they are asked if they want to participate.  By opting in, they give the College Board permission to share their name and limited information with college and scholarship programs looking for students like them. The College Board never shares social security number, actual test scores, self-reported parental income, disabilities, or phone numbers as part of Student Search Service. Participation is completely voluntary and students can opt out at any time. Eligible institutions sign a license agreement with the College Board, and the College Board consistently monitors their use of student information for compliance. After a five year term, the institutions must permanently destroy the data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Does the College Board make unsolicited phone calls or send unsolicited texts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not send students text messages or emails or call them on the phone unless they specifically opt in to the communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Our Commitment to Student Data Privacy&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The College Board is announcing a partnership with AIR Assessment, a division of American Institutes for Research (AIR), to use its platform to deliver a digital version of the SAT Suite of Assessments. The partnership with AIR Assessment marks the next phase in the College Board’s digital evolution, responding to the needs of many educators and students. AIR Assessment is a best-in-class and trusted digital provider with which many states and districts are familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This December, the College Board will pilot a digital, non-operational version of the SAT during school day administrations in partner districts on AIR Assessment’s platform. The pilot is an opportunity to test administration processes and instructions related to the use of the AIR Assessment platform prior to operational administrations. In spring 2018, operational versions of the digital SAT—in which students will receive college-reportable scores—will be offered in districts in Ohio and in a limited number of additional districts throughout the U.S. The PSAT 8/9 will also be administered digitally in districts across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the College Board will offer a digital SAT option during the school day to all interested states, districts, and schools. A paper and pencil version of the SAT will continue to be available in order to make the test as accessible as possible to all students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have heard from many educators and students who are asking for a digital version of the SAT,” said Cyndie Schmeiser, Senior Advisor to the President at the College Board. “We are pleased to be able to offer the SAT and its related assessments in both paper and pencil and digital formats to accommodate the needs of those we serve.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In AIR Assessment, the College Board has selected a partner organization that shares its commitment to opportunity and access for all students,” said Jon Cohen, President, AIR Assessment. “Our online testing platform reflects this commitment by providing industry-leading accessibility, tools, and embedded supports. Dozens of states have successfully adopted our online testing system, without the need for large infrastructure investments, enabling the College Board to deliver digital assessments to any school, district, or state that wants an online option.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board currently offers digital testing with its CLEP, ACCUPLACER, and SpringBoard assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College Board Partners with AIR Assessment to Expand Digital SAT Testing&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The time allotted for a specific math or reading section, either section 8 or 9 depending on the edition, was incorrect in the student test books and correct in the script and manual provided to test center supervisors. The student test books said the section was 25 minutes, while the manual and script contained the correct time limit of 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We apologize for this error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as ETS became aware of the error, during the administration of the test, they worked to provide accurate guidance to supervisors and administrators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After review and analysis , the College Board and ETS have determined that the affected sections will not be scored and we will still be able to provide reliable scores for all students who took the SAT on June 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To accommodate the wide range of incidents that can impact a test administration, the SAT is designed to collect enough information to provide valid and reliable scores even with an unscored section. From fire drills and power outages to mistiming and disruptive behavior, school-based test administrations can be fragile, so our assessments are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colleges and universities can be confident that the scores are valid. We expect to deliver scores to students within the usual timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We take our responsibility to students very seriously, and we regret the confusion some students experienced.

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the frequency of its use to the high stakes attached to it, standardized testing is among the biggest hot-button topics in education today. The number of educators and families disputing its necessity has only risen over the years, with the last few years seeing a spike in the number of students opting out of participating in their states&#039; annual tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may come as some surprise that one of the first people who will admit that the current testing model is broken is also at the helm of the company that produces some of the biggest tests in K-12 and higher ed, the Advanced Placement and SAT exams. But according to College Board President and CEO David Coleman, &quot;Assessment without opportunity is dead. We don&#039;t need more tests. We need more opportunities.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Everything I&#039;ve seen convinces me that assessments alone don&#039;t solve problems,&quot; he told a packed theater at the New York Times Schools For Tomorrow Conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite admissions officers frequently citing the SAT&#039;s ability to help identify &quot;diamonds in the rough,&quot; data shows more than half of high-achieving low-income students taking the exam don&#039;t apply to highly selective schools. On the AP front, 14 states had no Hispanic or black exam-takers, and less than 20% women taking the AP Computer Science exam in 2010.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;We hoped assessment would level the playing field, but found that a test-prep industry arose that fostered the perception that testing merely recapitulates the inequalities tearing our society apart,&quot; Coleman said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For Coleman, it&#039;s not enough for College Board to say problems like inequities in course access, test-prep, and performance aren&#039;t their fault. &quot;It may not be our fault, but it is our problem.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, the company has detailed four rules for assessments that advance opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Assess only what students learn in the classroom and will use again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman illustrated this rule by asking the audience to consider SAT words, which might be defined as words a test-taker likely hadn&#039;t heard before and won&#039;t likely hear again. &quot;In fact, they&#039;re called SAT words because the only place you can reliably find them is on an SAT. But that&#039;s not OK.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, students shouldn&#039;t have to learn things simply because they&#039;re on a test, but because those things will have lasting value to their life and future success. For that reason, the SAT no longer has &quot;SAT words&quot; and instead features words (i.e. synthesis, analysis) that students will use numerous times throughout college coursework and career training. Additionally, the exam narrowed its math focus instead of trying to cover the topic in a manner that was &quot;a mile wide and an inch deep.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Ensure all students claim the opportunities they&#039;ve earned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixing the test was just the first step, Coleman said. When examining why low-income high-achievers didn&#039;t apply to highly selective colleges, College Board found that one major hindrance was application fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working with colleges, the company is now able to provide four fee waivers to all low-income students taking the SAT. In Advanced Placement, College Board has also launched an &quot;all-in&quot; campaign to improve the number of black and Latino students taking exams. In 2015, Coleman said, the number of states lacking black or Latino AP Computer Science exam takers was down to one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Assessments must earn students and families something worthwhile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students shouldn&#039;t be told to take a test &quot;because they have to,&quot; Coleman said. &quot;Students don&#039;t buy it, teachers don&#039;t buy it, and, increasingly, parents don&#039;t buy it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Advanced Placement, he said, students and teachers have an exact reason for why they&#039;re working hard: college credit. For that reason, the PSAT also now carries an additional $180 million in scholarship opportunities as part of College Board&#039;s partnerships with National Merit, the United Negro College Fund, the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, and the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Remember what assessments can&#039;t do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, Coleman told those gathered, is the most important rule because it hinges on the work students and teachers do every day. &quot;The only things that change performance are productive practice and great courses.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further assist in-class efforts, the College Board also partnered with Khan Academy to provide free test prep courses worldwide. The site launched this summer and has already been used by hundreds of thousands of unique users, who have solved over four million problems, according to Coleman. Additional partnerships with the Boys &amp;amp; Girls Clubs are meant to further ensure access to this material. For students who primarily only have Internet access via smartphone, the company is enabling them to take paper-and-pencil practice exams, which they can then snap a photo of and send over for grading and personal practice recommendations from Khan Academy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond making top-quality test prep free and equal, however, Coleman stresses the importance of daily work in class with teachers, using high-quality curriculum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&#039;s time to stop lecturing folks that assessments are worth it and to prove it,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;In the News: How the College Board changed its standardized testing approach&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>A note to our members regarding today’s Reuters articles</title>

&lt;p&gt;We agree that the challenges of test security internationally are escalating. Like many technology and publishing companies who are protecting patents and copyrights, we’re facing cartel-like companies in China and other countries that will stop at nothing to enrich themselves. These bad actors will continue to lie, cheat, and steal to the detriment of students who work hard and play by the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board is not perfect; we did our best with the information we had at the time. We can and should do more. In fact, we have recently taken more aggressive actions to secure the exam internationally, including canceling an administration in China. We continue to balance widening access with protecting the exam. We recently refused entry to the first administration of the redesigned SAT to a number of high-risk registrants — many of whom make a living violating security protocols. In the future, we will need to do even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been working with Reuters on these stories since summer 2015. During that period, we’ve made College Board leadership available for multiple interviews and shared more details about test security than we’ve provided any other news organization. We’ve been transparent with Reuters in an effort to make sure its readers better understand all that we do to protect the integrity of the SAT internationally and ensure the validity of the test scores we report. In the spirit of full transparency, we are sharing here the &lt;a href=&quot;https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/reuters-response.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;detailed letter&lt;/a&gt; we sent to Reuters with the facts of our decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as we recognize where we need to do more, we are so proud of the new SAT and its impact on students. This is a time of remarkable, positive change for our century-old organization. In early March, more than 460,000 students took the redesigned SAT, which better reflects what students are learning in the classroom and connects them with distinct opportunities such as free practice tools and college application fee waivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are especially grateful to Cyndie Schmeiser and Stacy Caldwell for leading the successful transition to the redesigned SAT. We should all be proud of the very real impact we are having on the lives of students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will continue to work with our members to expand educational opportunities for students everywhere in the world while doing all that we can to protect those students from the bad actors who lie, cheat, and steal for personal gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;A note to our members regarding today’s Reuters articles&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>A Note to Our Members about Test Security</title>

The sad truth is that cheating is as old as testing. But the internet age brings new challenges that are in no way unique to the College Board. Every testing organization — including all of the major undergraduate and graduate program admissions tests — reuse some test questions or forms. Targeted reuse is one way testing organizations ensure quality and comparability of tests over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the reporting and internet message board activity related to cheating is focused on the old SAT. As of March 2016, there is a new SAT. Along with that redesign, we are working with our K-12 and higher ed members to examine all of our security policies and take bold steps to ensure the integrity of every administration. We’ve increased test form development to reduce form reuse, strengthened our prevention and detection techniques, and bolstered efforts to monitor and remove test content illegally posted online. We can, and will, do more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of students work hard, play by the rules, and do their best on the SAT and other tests. Assessment providers, the media, and the whole education community owe it to those students to stay focused on the real problem — those who cheat and steal for their own gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;A Note to Our Members about Test Security&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
