Ericka will lead our overall work in Membership, Governance, and Higher Education, ensuring effective integration and collaboration among these critical divisions. By uniting these teams under Ericka’s leadership, we are better positioned to work together with our members across our constituencies, achieve our goals, and propel students into opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericka brings to the College Board a wealth of experience and a track record of delivering access and opportunity to students. Throughout her career, she has taken on complex, highly visible projects and worked with a range of stakeholders to deliver results. She has managed large teams across many disciplines, including strategic planning, public policy development and advocacy, executive recruitment, and fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericka joins the College Board from the U.S. Department of Education, where she served as Senior Advisor to Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. In that role, she led cross-agency teams working on issues that included higher education funding and grant-making. Prior to her work at the Department, Ericka served as the Vice President for Operations and Strategic Leadership for The Education Trust, a renowned national education nonprofit. As chief operating officer for Ed Trust, she ensured the effective development and implementation of a 10-year strategic plan, led a comprehensive board development process, and guided the organization through a significant period of growth, which included the establishment of a new state office and three supporting organizations. Under her leadership, Ed Trust was recognized as a &lt;em&gt;Great Place to Work&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Washingtonian&lt;/em&gt; magazine. Other previous roles included Vice President and Director at the executive search firm Isaacson, Miller, where she led the K-12 education practice, and the McKenzie Group (now part of American Institutes for Research), where she served as President and COO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericka earned her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University and her master’s and doctoral degrees in English literature from Stanford University. She is a former English professor at Mills College in Oakland where she taught American literature and persuasive writing. Ericka was born and raised in Alexandria, Va., and still considers the T. C. Williams Titans her favorite sports team. She enjoys active travel, community service, and following the teenage adventures of her twin nephews.&lt;/p&gt;
