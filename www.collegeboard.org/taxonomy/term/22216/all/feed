&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the full letter: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November 19, 2014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Colleague:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a country, we are leaving far too much talent on the table. Too many high achieving African American, Latino, and Native American students — students who have demonstrated the potential to do well in Advanced Placement® (AP®) courses — are not enrolling in those courses. This is an enormous missed opportunity for them and for all of us working for a stronger, fairer, and more secure nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ground that’s been gained for these students has largely been the result of the inspired and dogged work of superintendents, school board members, staff, and teachers in our major cities. The new partnership between the Council of the Great City Schools, the College Board, and the White House — through its My Brother’s Keeper initiative — aims to bolster the good work already under way, share lessons learned as broadly as possible, and dramatically increase the proportion of students of color with AP potential who are enrolled in AP courses. We are pleased to announce that the National Council of La Raza, the National Urban League, and The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights will also be joining us in this effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real success of this effort depends on you, your schools, counselors, and teachers. Success — we have learned from leading districts — is a dynamic mixture of good data and human interaction. Without the data, we can’t effectively target outreach and resources. The College Board’s AP Potential™ tool provides critical information about which students have demonstrated — by their performance on the PSAT/NMSQT® — potential to succeed in AP. PSAT/NMSQT scores often uncover academic ability that might otherwise be overlooked, and they spotlight those students ready to be successful in AP. And in focus group after focus group, these students tell us that the single most important factor in their decision to take an AP class was the support and encouragement from adults in their school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are in the strongest position to make a difference — by establishing a clear districtwide priority, by setting public goals for improvement, by monitoring progress at individual schools, and by providing guidance and support to your principals as they encourage students with AP potential to take these courses. We at the College Board and the Council of the Great City Schools have found our collaboration to be invaluable, and we believe that you will too. We have asked the College Board’s regional vice presidents to set up meetings in December with each of you. The purpose of these meetings is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review the PSAT/NMSQT data for your districts and schools;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set goals for improving AP enrollment of African American, Native American, and Latino students this spring;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify needs that your district will have in meeting these goals; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assess how the College Board and the Council can help you meet these goals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For reference, we are including a possible agenda for these meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next couple of weeks, a member of the College Board staff will be in touch with you about setting up an initial meeting. In the interim, we invite you to view this webinar about the steps you can take to propel our students forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you will consider sharing it with the principals and counselors in your district as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or need any additional information, please feel free to reach out to Amy Wilkins (&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:awilkins@collegeboard.org&quot;&gt;awilkins@collegeboard.org&lt;/a&gt;) or Ray Hart (&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:rhart@cgcs.org&quot;&gt;rhart@cgcs.org&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Casserly&lt;/strong&gt;, Executive Director of the Council of the Great City Schools and &lt;strong&gt;David Coleman&lt;/strong&gt;, President and CEO of the College Board&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Letter to CGCS Superintendents from David Coleman and Michael Casserly&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>An Interview with Trustee Joseph Dragone</title>

Dragone, College Board trustee and superintendent of schools at Ballston Spa Central School District in New York.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over the course of his career, Dr. Dragone has led urban and suburban districts through school and district improvement planning, instructional technology implementation, data analysis, organizational and instructional capacity-building, and much more. He spoke about his career, the U.S. educational landscape, and the College Board&#039;s impact.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What led you to education? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: It&#039;s an interesting path. I really wanted to be a musician [he played the saxophone], and while growing up in Buffalo, NY, I had the opportunity work with many great musicians throughout high school—most of them were also teachers. The advice I received then was, “Get a degree in education, and you can have the best of both worlds”—I could share my craft with people as a performer and with students as a teacher. So I received my Bachelor of Science degree and my first Masters in Music Education, and I taught middle school and high school band for six years. The program was successful, so one of my principals suggested I get into administration, as there is a need for strong leadership. So I went back for my administrative certification and ultimately a Masters, Certificate of Advanced Study, and Ph.D. in Educational Administration and Policy.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What&#039;s the most critical issue in education today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: There are several significant issues, especially as the policy field is so dynamic. I think one of the biggest is access to opportunity, which is why I enjoy my work with the College Board—we share that core value. In New York, the popular political mantra is that your zip code shouldn&#039;t determine your educational opportunities; but the reality is, it does, and politically, no one wants to tackle this problem. Locally, in my world every day, we keep this issue in the forefront of all of our work to start with, understanding that our role is to provide opportunity for kids. That takes many forms—coursework, personal supports, mental and behavioral health services, after-school programs—all of which supports further opportunity for kids after they leave high school.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What do you love about your job?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Knowing that I can make a difference at the systems level. When you can change the system, you can have a holistic impact on what can happen moving forward. I do miss working directly with kids on a day-to-day basis, but it&#039;s very satisfying to see when I&#039;ve had an impact on an initiative or program to create opportunity for kids.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: In your professional life, which accomplishment are you most proud of?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: That&#039;s like asking a parent what child is their favorite! If I’m picking one, I have to say it&#039;s the work I&#039;ve done building relationships to strengthen my organization. My district is fortunate to&#039;ve been recognized at many levels for various accolades—as have I—for leading work on behalf of children. But none of this would be possible without building relationships across the organization or building a collaborative culture with high expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: In your view, what’s the most significant way the College Board is making an impact these days?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: As far as I&#039;m concerned, it&#039;s about changing the narrative regarding access and opportunity, and in turn having a major impact on many more students at scale. It&#039;s no mystery that the SAT, AP, etc. used to be regarded as elite opportunities—that was the perception, even though it was never really the case. I give tremendous credit to [current College Board President and CEO] David Coleman for changing that narrative over the past several years, and I think now we are really seeing this shift take root. Our work is for all students, and everyone benefits from access to challenging coursework and the best educational opportunities. The organization’s reach has grown exponentially, and our collaborative work with national organizations that share our mission is expanding our reach by leaps and bounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;An Interview with Trustee Joseph Dragone&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
