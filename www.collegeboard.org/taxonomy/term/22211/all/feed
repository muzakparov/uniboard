&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the full letter: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November 19, 2014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Colleague:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a country, we are leaving far too much talent on the table. Too many high achieving African American, Latino, and Native American students — students who have demonstrated the potential to do well in Advanced Placement® (AP®) courses — are not enrolling in those courses. This is an enormous missed opportunity for them and for all of us working for a stronger, fairer, and more secure nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ground that’s been gained for these students has largely been the result of the inspired and dogged work of superintendents, school board members, staff, and teachers in our major cities. The new partnership between the Council of the Great City Schools, the College Board, and the White House — through its My Brother’s Keeper initiative — aims to bolster the good work already under way, share lessons learned as broadly as possible, and dramatically increase the proportion of students of color with AP potential who are enrolled in AP courses. We are pleased to announce that the National Council of La Raza, the National Urban League, and The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights will also be joining us in this effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real success of this effort depends on you, your schools, counselors, and teachers. Success — we have learned from leading districts — is a dynamic mixture of good data and human interaction. Without the data, we can’t effectively target outreach and resources. The College Board’s AP Potential™ tool provides critical information about which students have demonstrated — by their performance on the PSAT/NMSQT® — potential to succeed in AP. PSAT/NMSQT scores often uncover academic ability that might otherwise be overlooked, and they spotlight those students ready to be successful in AP. And in focus group after focus group, these students tell us that the single most important factor in their decision to take an AP class was the support and encouragement from adults in their school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are in the strongest position to make a difference — by establishing a clear districtwide priority, by setting public goals for improvement, by monitoring progress at individual schools, and by providing guidance and support to your principals as they encourage students with AP potential to take these courses. We at the College Board and the Council of the Great City Schools have found our collaboration to be invaluable, and we believe that you will too. We have asked the College Board’s regional vice presidents to set up meetings in December with each of you. The purpose of these meetings is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review the PSAT/NMSQT data for your districts and schools;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set goals for improving AP enrollment of African American, Native American, and Latino students this spring;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify needs that your district will have in meeting these goals; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assess how the College Board and the Council can help you meet these goals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For reference, we are including a possible agenda for these meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next couple of weeks, a member of the College Board staff will be in touch with you about setting up an initial meeting. In the interim, we invite you to view this webinar about the steps you can take to propel our students forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you will consider sharing it with the principals and counselors in your district as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or need any additional information, please feel free to reach out to Amy Wilkins (&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:awilkins@collegeboard.org&quot;&gt;awilkins@collegeboard.org&lt;/a&gt;) or Ray Hart (&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:rhart@cgcs.org&quot;&gt;rhart@cgcs.org&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Casserly&lt;/strong&gt;, Executive Director of the Council of the Great City Schools and &lt;strong&gt;David Coleman&lt;/strong&gt;, President and CEO of the College Board&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Letter to CGCS Superintendents from David Coleman and Michael Casserly&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Valencia Grayson is an accomplished multi-sport athlete who hopes to play volleyball at a Division 1 university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Blue has his eyes set on attending Lamar University in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tatiana Thelusma wants to go to a college outside of her home state of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reach their goals, each of the high school seniors dedicated themselves to raising their SAT scores. With the support of their teachers, they learned about Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/associated-press/free-test-preparation-program-for-revamped-sat-goes-online.html&quot;&gt;Launched more than a year ago&lt;/a&gt;, Official SAT Practice provides all students with free and interactive test practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking the PSAT/NMSQT, Valencia, Matthew, and Tatiana connected their College Board and Khan Academy accounts and received personalized practice plans. By linking their accounts, they were able to easily identify and home in on the areas where they needed to improve. After committing themselves to hours of practice each week – sometimes during school in the classroom, sometimes after school in the library, sometimes at home or on the road using a mobile device – their hard work paid off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valencia boosted her SAT score 470 points when she took it months after the PSAT/NMSQT. She has since received more than a dozen emails and calls from colleges trying to recruit her. Matthew increased his SAT score 200 points from his PSAT/NMSQT score. Tatiana’s SAT score went up 250 points, and she’s now thinking about applying to out-of-state schools that she considered out of reach before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Valencia, Matthew, and Tatiana were in Miami last Thursday sharing their powerful stories with educators at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cgcs.org/&quot;&gt;Council of the Great City Schools (CGCS)&lt;/a&gt; fall conference. During a moving program inside a packed convention hall, College Board President David Coleman and Khan Academy Founder and CEO Sal Khan brought these three remarkable students on stage, where they received a standing ovation from hundreds of superintendents and education leaders, representing 70 of the largest school districts in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Valencia, Matthew, and Tatiana show what is possible through devoted practice. There are tens of thousands of other students who are following the path they have blazed through practice on Khan Academy,” Coleman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/photos/xLiGYjBntuK9aFbp7&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://i1054.photobucket.com/albums/s490/uvasig/SATpractice_Students_Photo1_zpsogftrz4r.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height:360px; width:540px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(From the left: Sal Khan, founder of Khan Academy; Tatiana Thelusma; Valencia Grayson; David Coleman, president and CEO of the College Board; Matthew Blue)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the conference, CGCS Executive Director Mike Casserly announced a new partnership with the College Board and Khan Academy to bring Official SAT Practice to even more students across the districts that comprise the Council. The “SAT Practice All In Challenge” will inspire students from these districts to sign up for the free practice resources and practice in a meaningful way. CGCS, along with the College Board and Khan Academy, will provide training to participating member districts and connections to local non-profit partners to maximize use of Official SAT Practice among their students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valencia, Matthew, and Tatiana hope that more students will benefit from Official SAT Practice, as they have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I liked that every time I got a question wrong, I was able to go back and do it again and get better and better. I was able to study and stay focused,” said Valencia, who attends Booker T. Washington High School in Houston. “Since getting my SAT score, I’ve gotten a lot of calls from colleges trying to recruit me. Now, I’m going to be able to apply to Division 1 schools that were out of reach before. I wouldn’t have been able to do it without Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“All I had before was a dictionary and books I could take from the library. When my teachers introduced me to Khan Academy I was so happy that it was free,” said Matthew, who also attends Booker T. Washington High School. “The website is simple and straight to the point. It really helped me with problem solving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With the PSAT score I doubted myself, but my teachers showed me with Khan Academy I could do it. If it wasn’t for Khan Academy I wouldn’t have access to SAT practice at all. It’s a godsend,” said Tatiana, who attends Oak Ridge High School in Orange County, Florida. Her SAT score has “opened doors” for her, including the opportunity to attend college in Georgia.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Miami, Valencia, Matthew, and Tatiana received a welcome befitting celebrities. After receiving a standing ovation, they walked off the stage to handshakes and requests for photos from educators, who in turn vowed to ensure that students in their districts benefit from Official SAT Practice too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, at dinner at a restaurant miles away from the CGCS conference, where they ate before flying back to their communities, there were spotted by an educator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Look, it’s the stars from the lunch session!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Three Students Show the Power of Productive Practice as a New Partnership is Announced to Bring Tools to Millions of More Students&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Challenge connected students from the nation’s largest urban public school systems to free Official SAT Practice, in an effort to boost college and career readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-eight big-city districts volunteered for the inaugural challenge, and five districts were honored with the following awards: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;California’s &lt;strong&gt;Long Beach Unified School District&lt;/strong&gt; received the “MVP” prize for having the highest overall percentage of students linking their College Board and Khan Academy accounts to receive free, personalized SAT practice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;California’s&lt;strong&gt; Fresno Unified School District &lt;/strong&gt;received the “Growth” prize for having the highest overall percent increase of students linking their College Board and Khan Academy accounts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Florida’s&lt;strong&gt; Orange County Public Schools in Orlando&lt;/strong&gt; received the “Student: Proof of Practice” prize for having the highest average weekly percentage of students with active Official SAT Practice accounts.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Colorado&#039;s&lt;strong&gt; Denver Public Schools&lt;/strong&gt; received the “Time: Proof of Practice” prize with its students logging the most minutes on Official SAT Practice per week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Illinois&#039;s &lt;strong&gt;Chicago Public Schools&lt;/strong&gt; received the “Problems Completed: Proof of Practice” prize with its students completing the most Official SAT Practice problems per week. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these districts will receive money to put toward initiatives that advance student success and opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are many success stories to share about the hard work and incredible growth that our districts and students made through this challenge,” says Council of Great City Schools Executive Director Michael Casserly. “We’re proud of the 28 school districts that stepped up to the challenge and hope others will follow.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our partnership with the Council of the Great City Schools and Khan Academy is helping bring these free, highly personalized practice tools to every corner of the country,” says College Board President and CEO David Coleman. “But make no mistake: behind every story of a student practicing on Khan Academy and succeeding on the SAT is a caring adult. We applaud the community of leaders across the five winning districts for their commitment to adopting these tools and propelling their students forward.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;GET READY FOR TEST DAY.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students who&#039;ve taken the SAT or a PSAT-related assessment can unlock a custom practice plan through Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy that identifies strengths and weaknesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The PSAT is now a diagnostic for Khan Academy,” says Khan Academy founder Sal Khan. “If students share their PSAT score, Khan Academy can use that information to provide tailored practice in math, reading and writing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C&lt;strong&gt;heck out the College Board’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/k12-educators/advising-instruction/practice-resources&quot;&gt;suite of educator resources&lt;/a&gt; to find ways to bring these free practice tools to students. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
