&lt;p&gt;Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval &lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.nv.gov/News-and-Media/Press/2016/Governor-Sandoval-Proclaims-December-as-Computer-Science-Careers-Month-and-Announces-Statewide-Computer-Science-Education-Initiatives/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Monday a partnership with the College Board and Code.org to pilot an initiative offering two new computer science courses, AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) and Computer Science Discoveries, in every school district in Nevada, beginning in the 2017-2018 school year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Computing is one of the top sources of new wages in our nation and there are thousands of current jobs and jobs of the future that will request skills in computer science. I believe it is critical that Nevada students have every option available to learn the necessary skills to begin a career in this exciting, high-wage, high-skilled field,” said Governor Brian Sandoval &lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.nv.gov/News-and-Media/Press/2016/Governor-Sandoval-Proclaims-December-as-Computer-Science-Careers-Month-and-Announces-Statewide-Computer-Science-Education-Initiatives/&quot;&gt;in his announcement.&lt;/a&gt; “This partnership with Code.org and College Board is an important first step toward providing great STEM and computer science access to classrooms across Nevada.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid growth of computer science course is undeniable. In its inaugural year, more than 2,500 teachers submitted syllabi for &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/stem/computer-science-principles?excmpid=MTG272-PR-1-prt&quot;&gt;AP Computer Science Principles&lt;/a&gt; (AP CSP), making it the largest AP course launch in history. AP CSP is being offered in 49 states, with approximately 25,000 students participating. The College Board has trained 2,600 educators to teach AP CSP, and 200 more have received scholarships to train for the course during Summer Institutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the College Board’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-a&quot;&gt;AP Computer Science A&lt;/a&gt; course continues to be the fastest growing AP course. With 57,937 students took the exam this year – an 18 percent increase from 48,994 in 2015. The number of students taking the course has more than doubled in the past five years, from 21,139 examinees in 2011 to 57,937 in 2016. The number of female examinees for AP Computer Science A increased from 18 percent in 2006 to 23 percent in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just how are these courses affecting students? At first, Karla Gonzalez, who participated in the AP Computer Science Principles pilot at Sweetwater High School in National City, California, was intimidated by computer science since she had very little experience with it. However, once she took the course, it opened her eyes to what the discipline is all about – especially the creativity aspect. Karla was inspired by the course to pursue a computer science major in college; her ultimate dream is now to work for Pixar. She is the first member of her family to attend college and currently attends San Diego Mesa Community College, with aspirations of transferring to a university that has a high-quality computer science program such as the University of California, San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Karla, today’s students know computer science is the new literacy – and these advanced courses are helping to shape the future of a tech-focused workforce. The introduction of AP Computer Science Principles follows an industry trend of involving more young women and underrepresented minorities in STEM. In fact, in a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/17/fact-sheet-president-obama-announces-high-school-graduation-rate-has&quot;&gt;White House announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the successful launch of AP Computer Science Principles was listed among “key signs” that “the country has made real progress to increase educational opportunity and help students succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;The College Board Celebrates #CSEdWeek&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
