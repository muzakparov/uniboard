The plan called for the construction of a performing arts center that would include classroom space and a 1,000+ seat theater.  The doors finally opened on the 1,049 seat OCCC Visual and Performing Arts Center Theater—fittingly on Valentine’s Day, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.428571429&quot;&gt;The sold out grand opening event featured a performance by the Oklahoma City Philharmonic and renowned pianist Valery Kuleshov. The Philharmonic, under the direction of Joel Levine, performed several pieces that included Tchaikovsky’s  “Fantasy Overture” and Rachmaninoff’s “Piano Concerto No. 3 in D minor, Op. 30” accompanied by Kuleshov.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.428571429&quot;&gt;The evening marked not only a significant accomplishment for the college, but also the underlying effect on students. “Involvement in the arts may be just what we need to be more successful as students, as a community, or as a nation,” said OCCC President Paul Sechrist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.428571429&quot;&gt;President Sechrist currently serves as a member of the Board of Trustees for the College Board.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.428571429&quot;&gt;“The value of the arts in education, regardless of a student’s area of interest, has a significant impact,” Sechrist said. “Students who participate in the arts are also far more likely to excel in science and mathematics. Low-income students who participate in the arts are more likely to graduate from high school and go on to college. College students of all majors are more likely to continue through graduation if they also sing in a choir, act in a play, or join the jazz band.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.428571429&quot;&gt;OCCC students agreed and have supported the project from the beginning. In 2006, students in the Leadership Council financially led the way for the theater by supporting an additional fee that provided $8 million dollars in bond funding for the theater project.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.428571429&quot;&gt;As students covered half of the estimated cost of the theater, gifts of $1 million dollars from the Sarkeys Foundation and $500,000 from the Inasmuch Foundation initiated a community fundraising campaign. Another two million dollars in donations from foundations, corporations and individuals, combined with OCCC capital improvement funds, set the stage for construction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.428571429&quot;&gt;The state-of-the-art facility was constructed in two phases. The college first completed the instruction side, which included rehearsal space, classrooms, library, studios and a variety of labs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.428571429&quot;&gt;Next was the theater, and after four years in construction, the Visual and Performing Arts Center Theater features state-of-art-equipment in a multipurpose hall that can accommodate any type of performance. Outside the performance hall, the atrium can accommodate 360 guests for pre-event receptions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.428571429&quot;&gt;Also included in the facility is the Inasmuch Foundation Art Gallery. The gallery opened with the art of former NBA basketball player and artist Desmond Mason.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.428571429&quot;&gt;“I am very honored to open this beautiful gallery. It is always a little nerve-wracking for me to put some of my personal pieces on public display, but the way they look in this space is incredible.” Mason said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is one of the nicest galleries I’ve ever seen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.428571429&quot;&gt;“As a leader of arts programming in Oklahoma City, OCCC values the opportunity to bring in art shows, musical and theatrical productions, surround-sound film screenings, and other live performances to the area, which has until now lacked a venue of similar size and capacity,” President Sechrist concluded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For more information about the OCCC Visual and Performing Arts Center Theater, or for information about the 2014-15 Performing Arts Series lineup, please call (405) 682-7295, or visit www.occc.edu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Oklahoma City Community College Opens Long-awaited Visual and Performing Arts Center Theater&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>For the Love of Art: 2016 Excellence and Innovation in the Arts Awards</title>

&lt;p&gt;The annual award recognizes and celebrates arts initiatives that serve students in grades 6-12 and promote learning and creativity in exemplary and innovative ways.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dougherty Valley High School in San Ramon, CA, won the overall award and first place in the “Civic Engagement” category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, Dougherty Valley High School’s AP Studio Art teacher Kelsey Wengel realized her students’ portraits were exceptional, but they didn’t tell a story about the subject. So she created the “The Beauty in Age” project — students would take a field trip to the local senior center, meet and interview a group of willing senior citizens from their community, and then create portraits of them. Each year, students prepare interview questions in advance, considering historical and world events they could ask about, and then spend the day with seniors who they&#039;re paired with. Students then get to work, focusing not only on composition and aesthetics, but also on the ways that their portraits might tell viewers something about the subject. The student art is masterful and varied, reflecting a true consideration of the unique qualities of their senior partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has become a highlight of our AP Art program. It’s something the students look forward to, and also something that our community has grown to acknowledge and support,” explained Ms. Wengel about “The Beauty in Age” project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added: “Many of our senior citizens sign up to be involved in the program a year in advance, and we still have students staying in touch with their senior participants. Some have been contracted to do commissioned pieces, and many have built lasting friendships with the families involved.  It really has built a bridge between families and generations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another winner, Hoover High School in San Diego, CA, took the top prize in the “Integration” category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a partnership with the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, high school English teacher Katalin Behumi and teaching artist Lorain Rihan collaboratively designed a six-week unit of study titled “Freedom of the American Individual.” The unit focused on a variety of historical/expository texts, including speeches and essays about individualism, transcendentalism, and civil disobedience and their influence on key civil rights figures like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The integrative arts project between the Hoover students and the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego proved to be meaningful for many of the students, who were able to express emotions that they had been holding inside for a long time,” said Michael Heu, ALMA Director and Publications Advisor at Hoover High School. “This project allowed students the medium to creatively release their feelings, and this project has shown to be a catharsis for providing some relief, which strongly connected them to the literature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Behumi and Ms. Rihan said one of the highlights of this experience was a day when half of the class wanted to stay after school to continue working on their prints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students had a gallery showing (and kickoff reception) at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego on June 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Equity through Arts” category winner, Howard Middle School in Orlando, FL, faced the challenge of being an arts magnet school where some students were unable to participate in arts classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Florida, students with low reading scores often cannot take arts courses as electives because they are required to take a reading course instead. In response to this barrier, Howard established Club Zero, a before-school program offering graded and structured arts courses taught by certified arts teachers. Course topics were selected based on student interest and have included Show Choir, Acting, Jazz Band, Studio Art, Animation, and Dance Troupe. School administrators report that Club Zero has created a high demand from parents and a sense of pride in the students participating. It has also created opportunities for students to exhibit their talent and hard work in public settings in the community — through partnerships with the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra and the Dr. Phillips Performing Arts Center, and at venues like the Lake Eola Bandshell and the Winter Park Sidewalk Art Festival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We congratulate all the teachers and students for all their dedication, talent, and passion to create meaningful art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;For the Love of Art: 2016 Excellence and Innovation in the Arts Awards&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>Trustee Pam Paulson on the Importance of the Arts</title>

She spoke to All Access this summer about why the arts are important — to her, and to all students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Access: What’s the most critical issue in arts education today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pamela Paulson: It’s really the same issue in education in general — the inequity of access to a rich curriculum, one that challenges kids and supports them so they can reach their potential. Sometimes the classes are less than inspiring, and many students tune out because they haven’t found something that sparks their interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kids from wealthy families find their way to the arts, while poor and underrepresented kids often end up missing out on the very opportunities that might be the most inspiring for them. They need to be exposed to high-quality arts learning that will both challenge them and support their brain development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes down to access for all students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: Do you have an arts background?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PP:  I majored in dance in college, which surprised my family — they thought I would major in math or science because I was in accelerated classes in high school. But when I arrived on my college’s campus, I went to a big auditorium to find out which classes had open seats. I got to the dance registration table, and since I had been a gymnast in high school, I decided on the spot that I would major in dance. When I told my father, he didn’t say anything negative about my decision, but he was worried I wouldn’t be able to find a paying job. Luckily I’ve never had a day of unemployment in my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often say that in the arts, you are probably better prepared for the future because most of your jobs will be created by you. You’re often at the bottom of the heap as an artist and arts educator, and you often don’t have a lot of money, but you always have an inner focus and passion for imagining, creating, innovating, and making your own path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arts are the best preparation for life — they give you focus, persistence, refinement, flexibility, and a love of what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: How does role at the College Board enhance your day-to-day work in the arts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PP: I started working on the College Board’s Arts Academic Committee in 1997, and it’s been an incredibly rewarding experience. I’ve always felt that the College Board valued the arts and treated them as equal to math and science; that has allowed us to have some wonderful conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board has such high expectations for kids and that’s really important. I love that there are opportunities for external measures of student performance, such as the AP® and AP Capstone™ courses and exams. In the arts we always say students need to do “real work for real audiences,” and they have to understand that there are high expectations. When you leave the stage as an artist, you hope that what you’ve done is of the highest quality so you feel pride in your performance and have communicated your message. The College Board sheds light on that process of practice and performance and helps us communicate that to our students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: In your mind, how essential is the College Board’s purpose statement of “challenging all students to own their future”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PP: When I think about the future, I think that we’re challenging students to be their best. They are going to be the citizens running the world. They will live and lead in the future. In order to have a democracy where ideas matter, where people discuss and debate, you have to have educated people. So students have a huge responsibility to be educated. Without education, they won’t have enough experience or insight to help make the decisions that will affect people who live in their community, state, country, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: What do you love about your job?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PP: I feel so lucky to have art in my life. I get to walk through our high school every day and see art on the walls and see students making art in the studios. I give tours to our many visitors and can show them that students are making artwork that expresses powerful ideas. Students have great insights and can lift you up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talk primarily about students because they are the focus of our school, but I find equal joy in doing workshops for teachers, whether on our campus or in schools around the state. We always have teachers creating art, and you see those same positive things start to happen that you see with students. In these moments they are more alive — they are actually making something, creating, working collaboratively, and expressing ideas. You can feel a new energy in the room and in their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: How do you infuse art into your personal life? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PP:  I still perform in informal settings. Down the street from my house is a Unitarian church, and when they have solstice performances and need performers, I will occasionally dance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I was part of a flash mob in a large office tower downtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, my son, who has learning disabilities, is a photographer. I think that’s one of the ways I’ve gotten immersed in art lately, by helping him find a way to express his ideas. I don’t have his eye for photography, but I’ve helped him put up some shows. I’ve tried to help him find his voice through his art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Trustee Pam Paulson on the Importance of the Arts&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
