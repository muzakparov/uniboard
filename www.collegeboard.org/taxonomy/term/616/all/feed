University of Texas&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; You can read the brief &lt;a href=&quot;http://educationcounsel.com/?publication=fisher-v-university-of-texas-u-s-supreme-court-amicus-brief-2015&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fisher v. Texas&lt;/em&gt;, first heard by the United States Supreme Court in 2012, is the extension of one of three cases that the Court has taken directly related to examining the admissions practices of colleges and universities (&lt;em&gt;Regents of the University of California v. Bakke&lt;/em&gt; (1978); &lt;em&gt;Grutter v. Bollinger&lt;/em&gt; (2003)). In the previous cases, the Court repeatedly emphasized a key point: that diversity on our college campuses – both racial and ethnic – is a “compelling interest” that allows limited consideration of those factors in the admissions process. Accordingly, admissions officers have been given significant discretion to consider both race and ethnicity as part of the decision process, provided there is a body of evidence supported by institutional research to support those practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brief makes clear that the strength of the U.S. higher education system comes from its autonomy and that “holistic review is a common, rigorous, and data-driven process, guided by well-developed evaluation system and informed by professional judgement in undergraduate, graduate, and professional school admissions that has been sanctioned by decades of Court decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brief is co-signed by three national professional organizations: the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO), the National Association of College Admissions Counselors (NACAC), and the Law School Admission Council (LSAC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will continue to provide updates and analysis on the case and its implications as it proceeds. Additionally, the College Board will be hosting a post-conference session at the Higher Ed Colloquium in January, and are in the process of identifying opportunities to continue to engage and inform members at the 2016 regional fora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANN ARBOR, Mich. — Kedra Ishop got results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year after Dr. Ishop began her new job here as enrollment manager at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/university-of-michigan?inline=nyt-org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt; — responsible for shaping the makeup of incoming classes — the university increased the number of minority students in the 2015 freshman class by almost 20 percent, to the highest percentage since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;African-Americans gained the most. It was a significant change at an institution where minority enrollment plunged after Michigan voters &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/09/us/politics/09michigan.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;banned affirmative action&lt;/a&gt; in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a courtship,” Dr. Ishop said, explaining the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Dr. Ishop may be showing the way forward for many colleges as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/10/us/politics/supreme-court-to-revisit-case-that-may-alter-affirmative-action.html&quot;&gt;Supreme Court considers&lt;/a&gt; a challenge to the affirmative action policy of the University of Texas at Austin, where she honed her skills. The case could result in a decision that applies narrowly to the Texas process, or it could take the bigger leap of ending the use of race as a factor in college admissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the court rules more broadly, public and private universities across the country that want to create more racially diverse classes will have to find new ways of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/university-of-michigan?inline=nyt-org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, a highly competitive public university, has long been at the center of affirmative action battles, with two landmark Supreme Court cases, both decided in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/24/us/supreme-court-affirmative-action-justices-back-affirmative-action-5-4-but-wider.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Grutter v. Bollinger&lt;/a&gt;, the court upheld the use of race as a factor in the university’s law school admissions, saying it helped achieve a “critical mass” of minority students. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/24/us/supreme-court-excerpts-justices-opinions-michigan-affirmative-action-cases.html?pagewanted=all&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the decision&lt;/a&gt; foresaw a day, perhaps 25 years in the future, when race-conscious admissions would no longer be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/24/us/supreme-court-affirmative-action-justices-back-affirmative-action-5-4-but-wider.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gratz v. Bollinger&lt;/a&gt;, however, the court struck down a system of undergraduate admissions that automatically awarded 20 points, a fifth of those needed to guarantee admission, to “underrepresented minorities” — African-Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans. The court said the point system was not individualized enough and violated the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Michigan voters took their own stand on the matter, in a referendum banning affirmative action at public colleges and universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee Bollinger, who was Michigan’s president during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/topic/organization/us-supreme-court?inline=nyt-org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; cases and now leads Columbia University, considers this chain of events a serious blow. “What is the reality that we are trying to address in our society, including at colleges and universities trying to build diverse student bodies?” he said in an interview. “It really is trying to overcome two centuries of legacies of discrimination and active disempowerment and wealth transfer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Richard Sander, an economist and law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and one of the most prominent critics of affirmative action, said that even though small racial preferences may be justified, when there is a very large disparity between the entering credentials of white and black students, black students become demoralized by their inability to compete and are less likely to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sander said he thought colleges were more concerned with having “a politically correct balanced student body,” in part by admitting wealthy black and Hispanic students, than with the harder work of finding truly disadvantaged students and giving them a chance to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What constitutes a critical mass, as the Supreme Court put it, of minority students at a place like Michigan remains subjective. As far as Robby Greenfield, a senior engineering student there and the former treasurer of the Black Student Union, is concerned, that number is still elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There needs to be enough to culturally shift the dialogue on campus,” said Mr. Greenfield, who is from Atlanta and whose parents are doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After thinking about it for a moment, he added, only half-facetiously, “I think it should be the same as the percentage of Michigan football players who are black.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle over affirmative action has been waged across the country as Arizona, California, Florida, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma and Washington have also banned the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://tcf.org/content/commentary/what-can-we-learn-from-states-that-ban-affirmative-action/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a report by the Century Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, a public policy research group, have been mixed. Seven of 11 flagship universities in those states achieved as much or more diversity through strategies like guaranteeing admission for top graduates from each high school in the state, giving priority to low-income students, improving financial aid packages, stepping up recruitment and eliminating legacy preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main exceptions, the foundation said, were the three most elite universities: the University of Michigan; the University of California, Berkeley; and the University of California, Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the long-term trend, Michigan officials are wary of calling their approach an unqualified success. They say one year is not enough to consider the matter closed, especially after years of sluggish minority enrollment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/FILED-14-981-bsac-U.-Michigan-11-2-15.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a brief that Michigan filed&lt;/a&gt; in the Texas case, officials told the justices that the overall drop in minority enrollment since 2006 was a “cautionary tale” about the difficulty of choosing a diverse class without being able to consider race. They said that since the statewide ban, a panoply of recruitment and outreach efforts had fallen short. Using low income as a proxy for race also had not been effective, they said, because there are far more white students than black students in Michigan who come from low-income families and have the threshold test scores for admission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they said that even now, the overall numbers of minority students are still lower than they were in 2006: 12 percent down for undergraduates and 14.5 percent lower for professional-school students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major problem, the brief argued, is that other elite institutions draw on the same population of blacks and Hispanics that it wants to admit. On this point, Richard Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, agreed, but he said the problem was that just about everyone else has affirmative action, not that Michigan lacks it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The University of Wisconsin can give you a preference, Princeton can give you a preference,” said Mr. Kahlenberg, who favors preferences for low-income students as a way of achieving diversity. “So if you’re getting into Michigan without a preference, you’re probably getting into an even more prestigious institution with a preference, and where are you going to go? You’re not going to go to Michigan. So Michigan has unilaterally disarmed in selection of black and Latino students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Greenfield, the engineering student, scoffed at this logic, saying that in his personal experience, it was not true that the Ivy League and Michigan were accepting the same students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Michigan, Dr. Ishop has focused on maximizing the number of students offered admission who enroll, what educators call “yield.” At Michigan, the yield is close to 70 percent for in-state undergraduates, which hardly changed from 2014 to 2015; for all freshmen, it was 45 percent last fall, up from 41 percent in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the 2015 freshman class was offered admission, everyone from faculty members to deans to alumni to students made personal calls to encourage students to attend. Student aid was increased and relabeled as “tuition” scholarships, because families were found to respond to that word more than to the dollar amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the size of the freshman class was cut, by 434 students to 6,071, and no one was admitted off the waiting list, which favors higher-income — often white and Asian — students, who can afford to put down a deposit to reserve admission at another college while they wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the number of black and Hispanic freshmen jumped by a combined 23.5 percent, the number of whites and Asians fell. Black enrollment gained the most, rising to 5.11 percent of the freshman class from 3.84 percent the year before, a gain that though small, just 58 students, has been surprisingly visible, students said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s black people everywhere,” Mr. Greenfield said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michigan students have expressed their sense of racial isolation by sharing experiences through a popular Twitter hashtag, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/BBUM?src=hash&amp;amp;lang=en&quot;&gt;#BBUM&lt;/a&gt; (Being Black at the University of Michigan). Mr. Greenfield said that in the wake of such protests, which began in 2013, the university had shown a new sensitivity, by improving minority enrollment and approving the construction of a $10 million multicultural center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julian Turley, who is also black, grew up in Grand Rapids, Mich. His mother teaches in the second grade, and his father, who died a year ago, was a truck driver. Mr. Turley did not get into Michigan straight out of high school, but he transferred from a community college after raising his grades a bit. He was glad he had been given a second chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between community college and Michigan had been “mind-boggling,” the senior said, peering through large tortoise-framed glasses as he ate lunch at a Mexican restaurant, part of his goal to try every restaurant in Ann Arbor before he graduates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s been a lot like drinking water from a fire hose,” he said of attending Michigan. “Whoa — there is so much opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnold Reed, a senior who came to Michigan from a private school in the affluent Detroit suburb of West Bloomfield, and who is applying to law school, said being one of a few black students on campus had made him stronger: “I have been driven because of those low numbers to succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Members in the News: As justices weigh affirmative action, Michigan offers an alternative&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Doug Christiansen, chair of the College Board&#039;s Board of Trustees, shared the following advice:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “The college essay is one of the only places on an application where a student can let the admissions committee hear their authentic voice and one of the only places for students to differentiate themselves from an ever-increasing pool of applicants, Doug Christiansen, Vice Provost for University Enrollment Affairs and Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid at Vanderbilt University told NBC News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Most highly selective schools, such as Vanderbilt University, are looking for students who have learned from a personal experience and then utilized that knowledge to somehow make a positive difference in the world around them,’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Leadership during personally challenging times is important, but so is being part of a team working together to create something positive,’ he added. ‘At the end of the day, we want to know who you are and how your experiences have shaped you and the world around you.’”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Facts About Test-Optional Policies</title>

Ninety years later, SAT scores are accepted by all U.S. colleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even schools identified as SAT optional use SAT scores for admission decisions when students submit them, and for making decisions about course placement, academic counseling, and scholarship and merit aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Best Predictors of College Success Are SAT Scores Combined with High School Grades&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to making college admission decisions, the more information the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://research.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/publications/2015/2/research-report-sat-validity-primer.pdf&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; consistently finds the SAT to be a valid and reliable predictor of college outcomes, including grade point average, retention, and completion. In 2016, with the help of colleges and universities, the College Board completed &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/pdf/redesigned-sat-pilot-predictive-validity-study-first-look.pdf&quot;&gt;a predictive validity study&lt;/a&gt; to see how well the new SAT predicts first-year success in college. The findings matched what colleges have seen for years: SAT scores, in conjunction with high school grades, are the strongest predictors overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as the SAT alone shouldn’t be used to make admission decisions, neither should grade point average. High school grades aren’t objective measures—they’re subject to variables like school demographics, teacher discretion, and state and district standards. And they’re increasingly subject to inflation. Since the late 1990s, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/program-results/overview-sat-suite-assessments/class-2016-sat-results&quot;&gt;the number of SAT test takers with an A average has gone from 39% to 47%, despite fairly flat SAT scores over this period&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trend has surfaced in public and private schools alike. Evidence suggests grade inflation is more pronounced in private schools and varies significantly by race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When subjectivity is unchecked, bias can go unchecked. The SAT and high school GPA are reciprocal checks and balances for each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test-Optional Policies Don’t Create Diverse Campuses &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s little evidence that test-optional policies increase diversity. Anecdotal accounts show such policies can increase the number and/or diversity of &lt;em&gt;applicants&lt;/em&gt;, but not of admitted students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2015 peer-reviewed study by researchers at the University of Georgia and College Transitions LLC found that &lt;a href=&quot;http://epa.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/06/12/0162373714537350&quot;&gt;test-optional admission policies don’t contribute to increased socioeconomic and racial diversity on college campuses&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the study authors also found that colleges enrolled &lt;em&gt;fewer&lt;/em&gt; Pell-eligible and minority students than similar test-requiring schools after they adopted these policies. They concluded: “In sum, findings from our analyses indicate that test-optional policies enhance the appearance of selectivity, rather than the diversity, of adopting institutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2014 Harvard dissertation evaluated the effects of Smith College’s test-optional decision over six years, and found that, during that time, &lt;a href=&quot;http://gradworks.umi.com/36/62/3662081.html&quot;&gt;black women were less likely and white women were more likely to apply to Smith&lt;/a&gt;. The author of the study concluded that simply introducing a test-optional policy doesn’t lead to greater diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Admission Policies Now and in the Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of U.S. colleges require SAT scores as part of the application process, and all of them accept scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fact has been obscured by the National Center for Fair and Open Testing (FairTest) through an online list, which currently cites 900 schools that “do not use ACT/SAT scores to admit substantial numbers of students into bachelor-degree programs.” A closer look suggests the number is much smaller:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;About 115 are for-profit schools, like the Academy of Couture Art, which has 17 total students.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;About 230 are special focus schools, like the Cincinnati College of Mortuary Science.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More than 70 are two-year or certificate schools, and an additional 315 are open-admission schools or schools that were never primary users of college entrance exams to begin with. Some schools don’t exist anymore, like Knoxville College, which lost accreditation in 1997 and has since stopped operating. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;After excluding these types of colleges (and those that require a college entrance exam for all but the highest performing students), only a small number of schools on this list —about 25%— prove to be true test-optional institutions for academic degree-seeking students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s vital that institutions clearly communicate requirements for admission, program placement, and financial and merit aid so that students fully understand them. The FairTest list undermines this imperative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As admission policies evolve, so too do the College Board’s programs and services. Together with our partners in higher education we aim to make the admission process as equitable and efficient as possible, with student success at the heart of our collective efforts. Institutions want to do better at recruiting and admitting a diverse student body; we are committed to helping them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A note to reporters: For inquiries about test-optional policies, please contact the College Board Communications Office at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:communications@collegeboard.org&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;communications@collegeboard.org&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or 212-713-8052. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;The Facts About Test-Optional Policies&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

At this special event, participating colleges not only offer advice and support to these students, but also grant on-site admission decisions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost 100 D.C. area students—armed with copies of transcripts and SAT scores, ready to have conversations with admission officials—gathered at the Marriott Wardman Park for this year’s event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www-origin.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/HBCU%20fair%204.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height:350px; width:527px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brianna Green, a senior at Columbia Heights Educational Campus, was one of the many students who arrived with a complete application, ready to take advantage of the opportunity. All Access was at the event and captured Brianna’s good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jElliTsWhjk?rel=0&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t know he was doing on-site [admissions]. I thought it was going to take a while for him to tell me if I was accepted or not, but it happened,” said Brianna, as she chuckled in amazement. “So everything fell in my lap for Norfolk [University]. I guess that’s like destined or something.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HBCU college fair also allows students to participate in workshops, led by experienced HBCU educational professionals, that focus on everything from how financial aid can make college more affordable to preparing for the full college experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www-origin.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/HBCU%20FAIR%205.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height:350px; width:527px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fair has grown every year; this year’s hosted the largest number of HBCUs yet, providing more options for students. After all was said and done, more than half of all the applications submitted on-site were granted admission. A few students were even offered scholarships to defray college costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board congratulates all students who participated, and thanks the following HBCUs for their support: Alabama State University, Montgomery, AL; Claflin University, Orangeburg, SC; Dillard University, New Orleans, LA; North Carolina A&amp;amp;T State University, Greensboro, NC; North Carolina Central University, Durham, NC; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, VA; Savannah State University, Savannah, GA; Shaw University, Raleigh, NC; University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.; University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Princess Anne, MD; and Virginia State University, St. Petersburg, VA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;HBCU College Fair Clears a Path for D.C.

During the GAAC’s most recent meeting, the council discussed several important issues and programmatic developments, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examining ways to better engage College Board delegates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communication strategies around Access to Opportunity&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; and the redesigned SAT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New programs including AP Capstone&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; and the College Financial Information Program&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SAT and college application fee-waiver policy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Higher Education Act Reauthorization recommendations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The council also discussed possible speakers, discussion points, and session topics for College Board Forum 2014. Philip Ballinger, Assistant Vice President for Enrollment and Director of Admissions for undergraduates at the University of Washington, College Board Trustee and Chair of Guidance and Admission Assembly Council discusses the work of the council below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;College Board All Access&lt;/strong&gt;: What are the top priorities of the Guidance and Admissions Assembly Council and how do they reflect major issues affecting guidance professionals right now? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phillip Ballinger&lt;/strong&gt;: I will highlight only a couple of the many priorities. Clearly, the College Board is on the move, and the pace is rapid.  We are concerned with growing and fostering member engagement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Coleman has been both clear and accurate – the efficacy of the many student access and success initiatives of the Board will depend in large measure upon the engagement of the members. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With good reason College Board leadership stole Frank Ashley away from Texas A&amp;amp;M to head up this effort as Senior Vice President of Membership and Higher Education Engagement.  One of his first initiatives will be centered upon onboarding new delegates of the various assemblies.  Frank has also made it very clear that we have a lot of work to do in communicating more effectively and usefully with College Board members in general. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, a new SAT is in our future. Implementing such a significant shift affects students, teachers, and administrators at every level – one can imagine all the practical issues that could and will arise. GAAC is a superb gathering of colleagues from high schools and colleges of every type to discuss these issues together, and to make helpful suggestions and recommendations to those responsible for the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CBAA:&lt;/strong&gt; Talk about some key takeaways from the council meeting. Were there any surprises throughout the discussions? Were any topics particularly divisive among council members?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PB: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes, we did have some surprises – positive ones.  We are encouraged by the entrepreneurial leadership in place at the College Board.  Of course, to be entrepreneurial is to also be creative and willing to take risks.  People have different thoughts when it comes to some creative thinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, what could be the role – if any -- of various types of corporations in the College Board’s initiatives around student access and success?  When could there be conflicts of interest or possible mission drift at play?  The dynamics between a broad engagement of societal resources of every kind -- whether public, private or corporate -- and the good of students are complex, and members of GAAC have definite (and various) opinions about what is and what is not appropriate. My GAAC colleagues are not a shy bunch! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CBAA:&lt;/strong&gt; Are there any new topics on the horizon that assembly members can expect to see on the agenda for the next meeting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PB:&lt;/strong&gt; Certainly testing and related items will be in the forefront.  Also, assembly members will hear about and engage much more with developing access initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Guidance and Admission Assembly Council Explores New Programs and Policies During Recent Meeting&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

University of Texas at Austin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and then in 2014’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-682_8759.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schuette v. BAMN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Michigan’s voter initiative that banned the use of race/ethnicity in admission at the state’s public institutions. The 21st century demands greater attention to access and diversity in higher education, as evident through our changing demographics, workforce demands, and other external pressures. Although these cases preserved colleges’ and universities’ ability to consider race or ethnicity in enrollment policies and practices, they also arguably up the ante for institutions that wish to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a carefully worded compromise decision, &lt;em&gt;Fisher &lt;/em&gt;emphasized that institutions must present sufficient evidence to demonstrate that their programs are appropriately designed and implemented. On the question of the necessity of using race and ethnicity (one of the relevant legal hurdles), the court underscored the importance of the serious consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives, concluding that if “a nonracial approach . . . could promote the substantial interest [in diversity] about as well and at tolerable administrative expense . . . then the university may not consider race.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Schuette, &lt;/em&gt;although all eight justices explicitly affirmed these principles, the majority made it clear that if voters decide to limit public institutions’ consideration and use of race and ethnicity in admission and other enrollment practices, courts may not stand in their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond keeping lawyers and commentators busy, these cases have central relevance to how colleges and universities can achieve their mission-based diversity goals. Specifically, these cases highlight the need for a more robust research effort and greater transparency to build public awareness and support. Institutions have many potential partners in these efforts, but more needs to be done to coordinate and collaborate across disciplines. Through its &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/higher-ed/access-and-diversity-collaborative&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Access &amp;amp; Diversity Collaborative&lt;/a&gt; and other efforts, the College Board looks forward to continuing to contribute to institutions’ efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first year attending Forum. I came mainly to network and to gain more knowledge about what’s going on in Higher Education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What sessions are you most looking forward to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breakfast. Just kidding! I’m really looking forward to “Boosting Success Among Young Men of Color” and “The Gender Gap in Higher Ed: Context, Causes, and Campus-Based Responses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high school I was that underrepresented kid. I went to a high school with a lot of other kids like me and no college recruiter ever visited us to tell us what our options were, or help us take the next step. I started my work in higher education because I wanted to give back; to give these kids a fair chance and make it equal on all levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s one thing you’ve learned so far?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just got here, actually. I was working this morning, doing an on-campus visit and meeting with 40 students. I’m looking forward to everything I will learn over the next few days!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will you take what you’ve learned at Forum and use it in your daily work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m eager to learn things I can really apply to my daily work; knowledge and tactics I can use to help get more kids where they need to be in terms of college access and success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Overheard at Forum: Andre Lawson, Admissions and Recruitment Coordinator at the University of Nevada-Reno&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Many use race-conscious policies and practices to achieve their mission-driven diversity goals. Some are forbidden by state law from considering race or ethnicity in admission decisions. Others are permitted to consider race and ethnicity but choose not to do so. All institutions do, however, have a common interest: identifying policies and practices that will create a dynamic, diverse, and successful student body. The recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling in &lt;em&gt;Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin &lt;/em&gt;and two new suits filed in late 2014 make this topic particularly important today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Jan. 26, at noon-1 p.m. EST, the College Board’s Access &amp;amp; Diversity Collaborative (ADC) will host a free webinar to explore the opportunities and challenges presented by race-neutral strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To register, please complete the brief registration form. The information you provide is confidential and will be used solely to invite you to the webinar and to contact you with any essential information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The webinar will be grounded in a new ADC resource on race-neutral strategies, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/diversity/the-playbook.pdf&quot;&gt;The Playbook: A Guide to Assist Institutions of Higher Education in Evaluating Race- and Ethnicity-Neutral Policies in Support of the Mission-Related Diversity Goals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Many other access and diversity–focused resources are available for free download at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/higher-ed/access-and-diversity-collaborative&quot;&gt;ADC’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to attend and to extend this invitation to your colleagues and coworkers.

The Colloquium is a gathering of professionals at all levels of higher education to discuss the topics and issues that matter most to them and their students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luna, a first generation college student, kicked off the conversations for the next two days with a keynote address that focused on what public education means to the common good. At a time when policy makers and the general public alike are questioning the value of higher education, Luna described the imperative of all higher education stakeholders to disseminate a common understanding that education is the key to choice, independence, and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He challenged participants to consider the following question: Does higher education as a holistic institution truly care about all students?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Colloquium, attendees will bring this question to bear as they discuss the most salient issues in higher education right now—including how college costs are affecting the middle class, communications strategies around the value of a college education, and the debate surrounding college rankings and ratings systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luna’s own college experience continues to inform his work to this day. He shared anecdotes about his time as an undergraduate at Stanford, which was not without setbacks. His message that the shifting demographics of this country necessitate a continuous shift in the approach of higher education institutions to serving and supporting all students set the tone for the next few days, and energized participants to prepare for these tough conversations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Paul Luna Challenges Colloquium 2015 Participants to Rethink their Approach to Serving All Students &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>College and University Presidents Discuss Higher Ed’s Role in Serving the Public Good</title>

&lt;p&gt;That was the overarching message participants at the Higher Ed Colloquium received from the “Conversation with Presidents” that opened the first full day of events On January 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in Delray Beach, FL. Following Paul Luna’s keynote the previous evening, during which he challenged the audience of higher education professionals to address the needs of &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; students, the session invited a careful and critical look into how individual student populations may influence institutional policy and culture rather than the other way around. Catharine Bond Hill, Wallace D. Loh, and Michael A. Sorrell, presidents of Vassar College, the University of Maryland, and Paul Quinn College, respectively, each offered ideas and advice that, though sometimes seemingly at odds, have contributed significantly to the success of their particular institution – success defined largely by their ability to produce graduates who are both employable and civic-minded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Montoya, the College Board’s vice president for higher education and international outreach, asked the panel a broad but daunting question: “How do colleges and universities need to step it up?”  It turns out that the different answers the presidents gave were shaped by a shared goal: to do what is best for the communities they serve.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For President Sorrell, that means placing a very conscious effort on confronting the issues that most directly affect the low-income students in his care.  And in their case, he says, their lives will be changed most by changing the urban environment in which they live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve decided to marry education with the public good, treat it as its own educational endeavor,” said Sorrell. “The public good occurs when you actually weigh into the issues and solve them. The needs of the community supersede the individual.”  As an example, Sorrell highlighted the dismantling of Paul Quinn’s football program and the transformation of its football field into an organic urban farm that now serves the local community, otherwise classified as a food desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation and entrepreneurship for the sake of the public good was also a theme of President Loh’s remarks. Loh likewise singled out a nutrition-related project at the University of Maryland, the Food Recovery Network, which provides food that would otherwise go to waste to people in need. But innovation and entrepreneurship should be the watchwords of the university, said Loh, primarily to solve “the biggest issue of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century: jobs, jobs, jobs.” At a large economically diverse institution like the University of Maryland, he argued, it is imperative to conceive of ways to educate everyone better, and at a lower cost for the more financially strapped. “Why are the low income students subsidizing the wealthy?” he asked. “I think we should raise tuition to help the low income students. Institutions must have autonomy [to make these decisions].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Hill warned that increasing income inequality will lead to problems greater than personal student debt. The likelihood that students from low income families will have access to educational opportunity at all, she said, is becoming ever more doubtful.  As a result, “I think we’ll see social stresses that will make this a country we don’t want to live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How can we make sure higher ed is part of the solution, and not reinforcing societal problems?” Hill asked.  “How do we frame this argument at the local level to get our states to reinvest in our students education as part of the public good?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hill agreed that serving one’s students and serving the larger good are not mutually exclusive, and, in fact, that you can’t do one without the other. “We have on obligation, even as a private institution, to serve the public interest,” she said.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College and University Presidents Discuss Higher Ed’s Role in Serving the Public Good&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
