&lt;p&gt;“The unconference style made [the AP Coordinators event] relevant and efficient,” said Christina Advento, a social studies teacher at American School of Dubai. “I came away feeling like I have new colleagues to exchange ideas with, a clear sense of next steps, and renewed excitement about my program and its future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one-day AP Coordinator event enabled attendees to create their own agenda topics and take leading roles in facilitating discussions. This design allowed everyone to explore AP-related issues that most concerned them and to learn more about what concerned their peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our vision for this forum was that it would be participant driven,” said Dennis Steigerwald, AP Coordinator at Singapore American School, which led the event with College Board International. “The day was structured into five sessions, relying on a breakout format to ensure that all participants’ needs and interests were met.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to receiving news and updates regarding AP, leaders from international schools with well-established AP programs had the opportunity to examine the new AP Capstone™ program in greater depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six Middle East schools are among the 20 schools outside the U.S. that will launch AP Capstone in August 2014. In 2013, more than 8,000 AP Exams were administered to students in the Middle East and North Africa, and the number of students taking AP Exams in the region increased by 16 percent, with the largest group of AP students from the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the growth of AP, student mobility in the Middle East increased from 2012-13 academic year as well. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iie.org/en/Research-and-Insights/Open-Doors&quot;&gt; Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange &lt;/a&gt; , the number of undergraduate students from the Middle East who were enrolled in U.S. universities grew 34 percent over the previous year, the largest percentage growth among international students from other regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, in addition to the six AP subject workshops and the AP Coordinator session that were offered, College Board International provided college counselor training to ensure that as more students from the region enroll at U.S. colleges and universities, they receive comprehensive college planning resources and support from their school counselors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College Board International will be returning to the Middle East Aug. 17–20 for an AP Summer Institute in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College Board International Partners with American School of Dubai to Host AP Teacher Professional Development &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The exam, which is accepted at almost all colleges and universities in the United States, is now more focused than ever on testing the few things that matter most for college and career readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As international students prepare for the first administration of the redesigned exam in spring 2016, here are five things they should know:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;During the process of redesigning the exam, the College Board International team engaged in conversations about the SAT with educators throughout the world. In addition, meetings with university admission leaders from across the U.S. included specific discussions on issues related to the international student experience. Their input and feedback helped ensure that the exam would remain relevant and meaningful for international students. We are also rigorously testing the exam through content reviews and individual item testing to ensure that it is valid and fair for all students.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The redesigned SAT measures the skills and knowledge that are essential for college and career readiness. This is true for all students, regardless of geography.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All students will benefit from having a clear understanding of what to expect when they take the exam. Every time students take the redesigned SAT, they will encounter a passage from one of the U.S. founding documents or the great global conversation they inspire. This refers to texts written not only in the United States but also important international texts, including pieces by Mahatma Gandhi, Margaret Thatcher, and Henry David Thoreau. Students do not need to have previous knowledge of any of the documents to successfully perform the analysis needed to answer the questions. The answer to every question in the Reading section will be based on the information provided by the reading passage.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rigorous course work — such as that done in the best classrooms around the world — will be the best preparation for the SAT.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As test day approaches, students can use our free test-prep resources to become familiar with the exam and hone their skills. Through a partnership with Khan Academy, we are making practice materials for the redesigned SAT available at no cost to students around the world. For students taking the current SAT, free practice materials are already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;available&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Find out more information about the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.42857143; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;redesigned SAT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Five Things International Students Need to Know About the Redesigned SAT®&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The day-long event kicked off with James Montoya addressing the attendees and highlighting the recently signed agreement between the College Board and the French Ministry of Education noting the College Board’s role in supporting and promoting the American section of the International Option of the French Baccalaureate (OIB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American section of the OIB combines the breadth and rigor of the French Baccalaureate with extra subjects in English language and literature and history and geography, taught and examined in English. This bilingual and bicultural set of courses and examinations certified by American and French teachers is offered in French schools in France, the U.S. as well as in 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; countries. It requires an ability to write and speak in English in an extended analytical mode and helps students demonstrate a level of English language mastery appropriate for U.S. college-study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;From Left: Lin Larson, senior assistant director of undergraduate admissions at the University of California, Berkeley; Judith Hegedus, executive director of the International team at the College Board; and Chirine Anvar of the French Ministry of Education take a moment to introduce themselves and exchange contact information.&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/OIB_15881514107_79b8b241e8_k%20%281%29.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height:300px; width:300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OIB American section is a well-balanced bicultural program that meets the needs of bilingual students, fosters international communication and understanding and provides students with a university  entrance qualification that is valid in both the U.S. and France  As part of this work, the College Board provides guidance for identifying and training American teachers; advises on teaching curricula and pedagogy; supports the design and review of exams items; and monitors and evaluates the effectiveness of the OIB program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the OIB discussion that took place at the December meeting, the French Ministry and the College Board were joined by international admission leaders from Columbia University, New York University, and the University of California Berkeley who discussed the various types of international students they encounter in their recruitment efforts. They also explained each of their institution’s college credit and recognition policies with regard to the French Baccalaureate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College Board Hosts University Admissions Roundtable for French Ministry of Education Delegation &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>Reflections: 2015 Chinese Bridge Delegation Program Connects U.S. and Chinese Educators in China</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the entry below, program participant Daniel Lowmiller, Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction at Green Local Schools in Uniontown, Ohio, reflects on this phenomenal educational and cultural experience:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deciding to take part in the 2015 Chinese Bridge Delegation was the right choice for me and my district.  I recently accepted a position in a new district where I play a role in the curriculum decisions.  Currently, we are evaluating the possibility of expanding our world language offerings and I thought this experience would arm me with knowledge about Chinese language and culture.  Additionally, I was eager to learn how the College Board could assist the district’s implementation of additional language opportunities for students.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The moment we landed in China, we were treated with nothing but hospitality and generosity.  After spending a day in Beijing receiving an overview of the educational system, getting to know our travel companions, and adjusting to the time difference, our particular group hopped a bullet train and departed for the port city of Tianjin.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The school visits in the province proved even more powerful than I had imagined. Staff and students alike were eager to showcase their talents, share their practices, and engage in conversation about how to continually improve instruction.  I learned that our educational systems have much more in common than differences.  I found most impressive the time and attention spent not only on academics, but also on the activities dedicated to ensuring students knew about their own customs and traditions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In addition to touring the school campuses and interacting with educators, we also had time to experience some of China’s national treasures firsthand.  We visited cultural sites and navigated through the streets, trying our hand at communicating with locals.  Of course, the trip to China wouldn’t have been complete without the chance to climb The Great Wall or wander through the Forbidden City.  Our visit was the perfect balance of past, present and future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://i1054.photobucket.com/albums/s490/uvasig/CBD_Image3_zpsevyvarat.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For me, the trip was an opportunity to learn about a part of the world I have little knowledge of, yet understand its huge impact on the U.S.  It was a chance to see for myself the need for our students to understand our country’s role in the larger global society.  It is essential that we have the knowledge of the other key players and have the ability to communicate and interact with one another in the future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is my hope to expand our district’s world language offerings and add opportunities for students to engage in learning Chinese language and culture.  With the knowledge and connections made during the trip, I will begin to have conversations about the possibilities of adding to our current courses.  Additionally, I will continue to have conversations with the educators at our host schools and talk about exchange visits for students and staff alike.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For me, this trip was much more than travelling halfway around the world.  It was also an opportunity to travel inward.  I would encourage others to branch out and experience this truly incredible endeavor.  I guarantee you will come home with knowledge and ideas to implement at school and at home!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://i1054.photobucket.com/albums/s490/uvasig/CBD_Image2_zpspxhpvufc.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From 2006 to 2015, more than 4,000 U.S. educators have participated in the Chinese Bridge Delegation. The program provides an opportunity for delegates to learn about a country that is rapidly changing and rising on the global stage. Delegates return to their own schools and districts with increased awareness and interest in providing international ideas and opportunities to their own students.

Read the letter below for the full story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Colleagues,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today we regretfully informed a set of students that we are canceling the Saturday, Jan. 23, SAT® international administration at certain test centers. This decision is based on evidence that some students have been exposed to test materials intended for this administration. We have done our best to limit the number of centers canceled and the impact to students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We maintain an unwavering commitment to providing a fair testing environment for all students and to ensuring the integrity of each SAT administration. When we have evidence of a security incident, we take all necessary actions to ensure the validity of the test results we deliver to you, our member colleges and universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know this a significant inconvenience for affected students who worked hard to prepare for this test. Next week, we will email students with details about a makeup test. If you receive inquiries from students, please direct them to our customer service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Email: sat@info.collegeboard.org&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Phone: +1 212-713-7789, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern Time   &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your partnership and your patience as we continue our work to ensure a fair testing environment and deliver reliable scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Important Information on January 23 International SAT Administration&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

In the spring, two events took place at the NYU global campuses of Abu Dhabi and Shanghai. The third took place at NYU’s main campus in New York City. The weeklong event at NYU brought together counselors and advisors from over 40 countries, ranging from Taiwan to Peru. Counselors provided insight and engaging dialogue about their roles in university counseling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During remarks, Linda Liu, the College Board’s vice president for International, emphasized the role of counselors in international secondary schools. “The idea of every student having someone in their life that can guide them and ensure that they are taking advantages that they’ve earned is powerful one,” said Liu. For many international students, having a counselor is a link to college and career aspirations in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admissions officers from premier universities—Columbia, Wesleyan, University of California-Berkley, University of Pennsylvania—and experienced international counselors led the summer sessions, which focused on central themes that counselors can use with their students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the welcoming ceremony, Shawn Abbott, assistant vice president and dean of admissions at NYU, praised counselors for participating in the Summer Institute. “I think one of the things that you’ll discover rather quickly is that as much as you are likely to learn from any type of lecture,” he said, “you are likely to be equally enriched by the network that you are about to develop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dialogue of the Summer Institute centers on inclusion, culture, and heritage. At the open dinner, individuals participated in the institute tradition known as “Jack’s Lounge,” where participants are encouraged to bring cultural artifacts and embrace conversation about various trips. Each story, conversation, and interaction provided new methods and connections for the future—a concept that the Institute hopes counselors will pass on to their students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on the College Board’s professional learning opportunities for secondary school administrators, teachers, and counselors worldwide, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/prof-dev/international&quot;&gt;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/prof-dev/international&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Summer Institute for International Counselors Focuses on Access, Culture and Heritage &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The exam, which is accepted at almost all colleges and universities in the United States, is now more focused than ever on testing the few things that matter most for college and career readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As international students prepare for the first administration of the redesigned exam in spring 2016, here are five things they should know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;During the process of redesigning the exam, the College Board International team engaged in conversations about the SAT with educators throughout the world. In addition, meetings with university admission leaders from across the U.S. included specific discussions on issues related to the international student experience. Their input and feedback helped ensure that the exam would remain relevant and meaningful for international students. We are also rigorously testing the exam through content reviews and individual item testing to ensure that it is valid and fair for all students.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The redesigned SAT measures the skills and knowledge that are essential for college and career readiness. This is true for all students, regardless of geography.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All students will benefit from having a clear understanding of what to expect when they take the exam. Every time students take the redesigned SAT, they will encounter a passage from one of the U.S. founding documents or the great global conversation they inspire. This refers to texts written not only in the United States but also important international texts, including pieces by Mahatma Gandhi, Margaret Thatcher, and Henry David Thoreau. Students do not need to have previous knowledge of any of the documents to successfully perform the analysis needed to answer the questions. The answer to every question in the Reading section will be based on the information provided by the reading passage.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rigorous course work — such as that done in the best classrooms around the world — will be the best preparation for the SAT.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As test day approaches, students can use our free test-prep resources to become familiar with the exam and hone their skills. Through a partnership with Khan Academy, we are making practice materials for the redesigned SAT available at no cost to students around the world. For students taking the current SAT, free practice materials are already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;available&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find out more information about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;redesigned SAT&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Five Things International Students Need to Know About the Redesigned SAT®&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
