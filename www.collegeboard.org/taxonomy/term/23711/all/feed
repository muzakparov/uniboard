Since the announcement, state officials, education leaders, and news outlets have voiced support for the change that will allow Michigan students, parents, and educators to take advantage of the opportunities College Board redesigned assessments have to offer. We&#039;re pleased to share a great editorial from the Detroit News. The full text and a link to the original article can be found below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State scores in switch to SAT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michigan students will take new college entrance exam in 2016, saving state money&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally posted on January 9 on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/01/09/michigan-chooses-sat-act/21458857/&quot;&gt;The Detroit News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to keep track of all the acronyms that fly around the education sphere, but the Michigan Department of Education’s decision to move to the SAT from the ACT is a significant change. While some school officials aren’t happy about dealing with a new test, it’s a switch that will save taxpayers money — and offer students some additional benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2007, all Michigan high school juniors have been required to take the ACT college entrance exam as part of the Michigan Merit Exam, in part to encourage more students to apply to college. Michigan law requires high school students to take a college entrance exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move to the SAT, starting in 2016, should be fairly seamless for students, according to department officials and some education reform experts. Like the ACT, the SAT will be offered free of charge to all juniors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everyone is pleased with this change. Some school administrators feel blindsided and upset they now have to meet a new target after years of building a curriculum around the ACT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Department officials should take these concerns seriously, especially since so much pressure is placed on schools to meet certain benchmarks on these tests. More leniency should be afforded schools as they transition to this new standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the financial savings are real, and it would have been careless of state officials to ignore that. The MDE said the College Board, which administers the SAT, won the three-year contract worth $17.1 million — a bid that was $15 million less than the ACT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Superintendent Mike Flanagan thinks this is a positive change, and points to how the SAT test “is respected and used around the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Their bid was rated the highest; provides valuable assistance to Michigan educators, students, and parents; is more aligned to Michigan’s content standards; and saves the state millions of dollars over the course of the three-year contract,” Flanagan said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MDE says to prepare for the new test, students can take practice tests, and teachers and other school officials will participate in professional development. This training is covered under the SAT contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students will benefit from these additional training opportunities. The College Board has partnered with Kahn Academy, the free, online learning resource, to provide free SAT preparation materials to all students starting in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Ackley, spokesman for the department, says nearly all colleges — including all universities in Michigan — accept the SAT test as well as the ACT, so students won’t be at a disadvantage for not taking the ACT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SAT tests students in reading, writing and math; the ACT has five parts: English, mathematics, reading, science and an optional writing test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education experts who have looked at the revamped SAT test — the one students will start taking in 2016 — say it will be more aligned to Michigan standards. Those include: requiring to back up claims, testing vocabulary in reading passages, fewer math topics but in more depth, and testing knowledge of U.S. founding documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition to the SAT will inevitably pose challenges at first, but the savings for the state and the added benefits for students made this the right call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Positive Response to Michigan SAT Announcement &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>Jalen Rose Leadership Academy to Expand Opportunity for Detroit Students Through New Focus on AP Courses</title>

Starting in 2017, the public charter school in Northwest Detroit will require that every student take a least one AP course as a requirement for graduation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My vision in founding JRLA was to provide Detroit families with a quality private school education in a tuition-free public school setting,” Mr. Rose explained. “To realize that vision, we have to set academic standards of excellence and provide the kind of rigorous curriculum that is common to the best private high schools. Partnering with the College Board to introduce Advanced Placement courses on a grand scale at our open admission Detroit high school is a natural progression as we continue to raise the bar,” the former NBA star and current ABC/ESPN Analyst declared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jalen Rose Leadership Academy will be the first school in Detroit to establish that its students – referred to as scholars - take an AP course as a graduation requirement. All students, save those with certain special needs, will be expected to meet this requirement. Additionally, any JRLA scholar on a path to a four-year college will be encouraged to take four AP courses, one in each core area of science, math, English, and social studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wendell Hall, Senior Director for Policy at the College Board, attended the event to support the kick off of the ambitious program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The College Board is committed to ensuring that all students who have the potential to succeed in AP courses are able to access those opportunities,” he said. “That is why we work with schools like the Jalen Rose Leadership Academy to remove barriers and expand opportunity. We thank JLRA for its efforts to provide access to the challenging course work that will prepare students for success in college.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with the Jalen Rose Leadership Academy to provide the AP program to its scholars is a part of the College Board’s efforts to deliver opportunity to students everywhere. Through the &lt;em&gt;All In&lt;/em&gt; campaign, the College Board is committed to working with educators to break down barriers and ensure that 100 percent of African American, Hispanic, and Native American students with the potential to succeed in AP enroll in at least one matched AP course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Rose stated that this commitment to raise the bar for students at Jalen Rose Leadership Academy reflects his belief that the majority of Detroit children who go to regular open-admission high schools have the same ability and promise as those accepted to the special test-admission schools in the city such as Renaissance High School and Cass Tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s time we set the same high expectations for all our students as we do for those who attend private or special admissions schools.  I have no doubt our scholars will rise to the occasion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jalen Rose Leadership Academy is managed by the non-profit &lt;a href=&quot;http://promiseschools.org/&quot;&gt;American Promise Schools (APS).&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.voyageurcollegeprep.com/&quot;&gt;Consortium College Prep&lt;/a&gt;, the other high school APS manages in Detroit, has made a similar commitment to increase its graduation requirements and introduce AP courses at an ambitious scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Jalen Rose Leadership Academy to Expand Opportunity for Detroit Students Through New Focus on AP Courses&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

To that end, he suggested that this may be the right time not only to ask new questions, but to revisit the answers to old questions and see if they still make sense when it comes to effecting change in higher education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In introducing the current state of higher education in America through statistics and common perceptions of cultural diversity, Strayhorn reiterated what many of the K–12 and higher education practitioners in the room knew very well: Despite record numbers of underrepresented and low-income students enrolled in secondary education institutions, these students are significantly less likely to finish than their white or more affluent counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strayhorn said that campus policies borne from the experience of “traditional” students won’t serve all students equally. There is an “experience gap” in higher education that is preventing many underrepresented and low-income students from reaping the full benefits of college — so we must begin to think about this problem differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went on to explore how building a sense of belonging on campus would lead to better completion rates. “You can’t really build community without knowing each other — and that starts with knowing someone’s name,” said Strayhorn. When students feel they belong, their confidence in their ability to succeed increases, and they are more likely to seek support, increase their self-efficacy, and earn a degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strayhorn offered several strategies that might help build this sense of belonging:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure the recruitment goals are practical within a campus culture&lt;/strong&gt;; if they’re not, that culture might need to shift. For example, if a school’s goal is to recruit more adult learners, but its faculty is unwilling to accommodate unforeseen scheduling circumstances common with this group of students (childcare, part-time employment, etc.), those policies must shift to ensure that adult learners feel as though they belong on campus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a program that matches underrepresented students with an “academic spotter”&lt;/strong&gt; who will act as a monitor for academic, social, and experiential progress and offer needed assistance when necessary. This should exist in addition to traditional support services on campus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students should be able to see themselves reflected on campus.&lt;/strong&gt; Efforts should be made to increase the number of faculty members from diverse backgrounds and to ensure that students have access to campus activities or groups that support them and celebrate their cultural heritage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recognize that while we as educators understand the culture and nuance of higher education, many people do not&lt;/strong&gt;. “We can act as cultural navigators and meet the needs of ordinary people,” he said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Revisiting How to Best Serve Underrepresented Students&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;These resources come from the Coalition for Access, Affordability, and Success (CAAS), a diverse group of 90+ colleges and universities that are committed to providing college access to students of all backgrounds. Growing &lt;a href=&quot;http://research.collegeboard.org/PUBLICATIONS/REVIEW-ROLE-COLLEGE-APPLICATIONS-STUDENTS-POSTSECONDARY-OUTCOMES&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;has shown that students from disadvantaged backgrounds especially struggle with the college planning and application process, often missing out on the opportunities they deserve. The group is committed to leveling the playing field by guiding students through every step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re providing tools and organization for students and schools that don’t currently have them,” said Will Herald, senior assistant director of admissions at the University of Chicago, who presented alongside Heidi Meyer, director of transfer admissions at the University of Minnesota–Twin Cities, at this year’s Midwestern Regional Forum. Herald and Meyer gave counselors, teachers, and higher education professionals an early look at three of the forthcoming platforms: the College Locker, the Collaboration Platform, and the Application Portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The college planning process starts with the College Locker, which will launch in April 2016. It will serve as a repository for a student’s “proudest moments and best work,” said Herald. Submissions might include graded analytic essays, videos of performances or robotics competitions, or photos from notable service projects.  Students can begin filling their “lockers” as early as they’d like, and can update and refine them at will.  At no point in the process will colleges be able to access this space, thereby giving students the freedom and flexibility to experiment with how they want to represent themselves and their accomplishments. And as they decide which of these materials they want to submit as part of their college applications, they can share these files with counselors and other trusted adults; the Collaboration Portal will provide a dedicated digital space for these exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in July 2016, high school seniors will also be able to access the Application Portal. Here they can maintain a detailed list of the colleges they’re interested in, see the admission requirements of each school, and submit application materials. Meanwhile, their high school counselors can monitor their progress electronically and use the platform to send transcripts and letters of recommendation to schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A counselor who attended the session was hopeful that this tool could help her and her primarily low-income and underrepresented students, but she wondered how it would address affordability; students are unlikely to plan for college, she said, if they don’t think they can afford to go in the first place. Herald was happy to announce that, over the next year, the CAAS will work with financial aid experts and school counselors to create more supports associated with applying for financial aid and scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;

The College Board’s Aaron Lemon-Strauss delivered this good news at the Midwestern Regional Forum, then passed the mic to two educators who’ve found innovative ways to encourage SAT practice in their own communities: Maria Salinas, site coordinator at University of Michigan-Flint’s Neff Center, and Mark Lomax, senior director of teen programming at the Boys and Girls Clubs of Columbus, Ohio (BGCC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salinas works in the Beecher Community School District, a rural area that serves about 1,000 students, 95 percent of whom qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. Partnering with GEAR UP Michigan, University of Michigan-Flint, and other local educators and organizations, she focuses primarily on helping 11th-graders prepare for the unique pressures and demands of the 12th grade and beyond. “All of our organizations work and learn together,” she said, emphasizing the power of groups uniting to ensure student success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Michigan began offering the SAT to all students, Salinas and her colleagues have started a number of initiatives to help students prepare for the test. Every junior in the district attends an SAT prep course during the “sixth hour” of their school day; three teachers lead these courses, with the support of a rotating group of University of Michigan students.  In October 2015, they also organized their first SAT Boot Camp, a four-day event created to motivate students to prepare for the SAT, familiarize them with Khan Academy’s practice resources, and reward them (with a pizza party and game night) for taking initiative. Salinas and her team are piloting a two-day version of this boot camp later in February, and hope to support more students with increased one-on-one tutoring and focused SAT practice time during study halls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over at the BGCC, Lomax has been thinking about how to use students’ out-of-school time to help them prepare for their future. In his communities, students suffer from low expectations, he explained — 65 percent of their parents did not graduate from high school and 95 percent are un- or underemployed. Because most of these students feel pressure to support their families, Lomax realized he may be able to increase participation in academic programs by providing a financial incentive. He asked his students to attend four three-hour SAT practice sessions (using Khan Academy) on Saturday mornings in exchange for summer job placement at a site that paid at least $10 an hour.  Thirty students signed up; of the students who had previously taken the SAT, 80 percent reported improved scores after these sessions. All 30 were placed in a summer job.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lomax also worked with local schools to ensure that the transition from using Khan Academy at school to using it at the Boys and Girls Clubs was seamless, and he instituted “power hour” tutoring sessions, during which students use Khan Academy resources to build foundation skills in reading and math. To continue this momentum, he plans to hold additional trainings for staff and volunteers, streamline implementation at all 10 local Boys and Girls Clubs so students can move easily from center to center, and encourage all students with smartphones to download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/practice/daily-practice-app&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SAT practice app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about one thing all educators could do now to support SAT practice, both Salinas and Lomax agreed: “When they say they don’t have homework, always get them on Khan Academy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see more tips for using Khan Academy resources in your own setting, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/k12-educators/advising-instruction/practice-resources&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;satpractice.org/k12&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;How Educators are Using Khan Academy in the Midwest — and Seeing Results &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Read the official statement from the university below or on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://source.wustl.edu/2016/03/ronne-patrick-turner-named-vice-provost-for-admissions/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ronné Patrick Turner, associate vice president of enrollment and dean of admission at Northeastern University, has been appointed vice provost for admissions at Washington University in St. Louis, effective July 1, according to Chancellor Mark S. Wrighton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turner succeeds John Berg, who announced in October that he would retire from the position June 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We could not be more pleased that our national search for our next leader in undergraduate admissions has led us to Ronné Turner,” Wrighton said. “She is an accomplished professional with a proven record of success in not only recruiting top students, but also ensuring that they are prepared to meet and exceed their goals throughout their college careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I also am extremely grateful to John Berg, who in his nearly 30 years of service — 22 of which were spent leading our admissions efforts — has overseen a significant increase in both the number and quality of applicants to Washington University. He leaves a remarkable legacy and a strong foundation for our next chapter under Ronné’s leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her new role, Turner will be responsible for planning and directing the recruitment of undergraduate students to Washington University and for implementing strategies to increase the strength and diversity of the student body. She also will oversee Student Financial Services, which is dedicated to making it financially possible for admitted students to enroll and for enrolled students to graduate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turner comes to Washington University after nearly 15 years at Northeastern, where she leads and directs undergraduate admission and enrollment for the university’s seven colleges and oversees the development and implementation of recruitment and enrollment strategies to meet objectives for freshman, transfer and international students. She also serves on the university’s Enrollment Strategy Committee, which is focused on scholarship and financial aid; and oversees the Opportunity Scholarship unit, which admits and supports approximately 75 first-generation students receiving a range of scholarship aid each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ronné brings the right mix of talent, skill and administrative experience to this critical role,” Provost Holden Thorp said. “As each incoming class becomes more accomplished and excellent in every respect, we are tremendously fortunate to have found the perfect leader to help us maximize the opportunity that is in front of us — to raise the bar, reimagine the possibilities and cultivate the next generation of Washington University students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am thrilled to join the Washington University team and to contribute to the university’s continued enrollment success,” Turner said. “I look forward to working with the entire university community to attract and enroll outstanding students from diverse backgrounds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to joining the Northeastern administration in 2001, Turner had worked for more than a decade at the University of Maryland, College Park, where she served in roles including admission counselor, assistant director for freshman admission, and associate director for admission marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turner also worked as an assistant director of admissions at her alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, where she earned her bachelor’s degree in social and behavioral science. She also earned a master’s degree in social foundations of education from the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among her professional associations, Turner serves on the Board of Trustees of the College Board and as chair of the National Guidance and Admission Assembly, and she has held positions with the College Board New England Regional Association and the National Association for College Admission Counseling. She was honored in 2011 with the Northeastern University Innovation Award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Supporting Counselors to Support Students: Professional Pathways in IL </title>

These are the counselors who typically need the most resources and support, yet they do not receive the funds or time to pursue outside professional development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professional Pathways, which operates through the Illinois Association for College Admission Counseling (IACAC), gives counselors the data and research, professional development opportunities, time, and supportive partners they need to develop new strategies and approaches for preparing their students for postsecondary success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We spoke with Gilfillan, president of IACAC and counselor at Woodlands Academy, and Drew Eder, a counselor at Highland Park High School and member of the IACAC High School Professional Development Committee, to learn more about the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The interview below has been lightly edited and condensed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Access: What motivated you to create Professional Pathways? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beth Gilfillan&lt;/strong&gt;: District Directions, the program in San Diego after which Professional Pathways is modeled, is data-driven and responsive to the particular needs of each district it serves. Its volunteer faculty spends over a year with its counselors, gets to know them, assesses their strengths and opportunities for growth, and tailors programs to them. I was amazed at this level of commitment and the emphasis on data and concrete programming. Often, professional development opportunities for counselors teach us about issues or updates in the college counseling world, but they do not offer strategies for improving or measuring the effectiveness of interventions. District Directions and Professional Pathways measure what is working and what isn’t and train counselors so they feel empowered to make changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After attending the two-day District Directions retreat in San Diego, I was determined to make this happen in Illinois. Through the support of IACAC’s executive board and the High School Counselor Professional Development committee, we were able to start working with a school district in late summer of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: Why is it valuable for counselors to have programs like Professional Pathways?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BG:&lt;/strong&gt; The landscape for high school counselors, especially in the college realm, is constantly changing. From new policies on admission tests and applications to financial aid changes, we have to continuously educate ourselves so we can best serve our students. Rarely is this education offered within our schools; usually professional development is geared toward teachers. And even when counselors are allowed to pursue training outside their district, they often need to use personal time and/or funding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professional Pathways aims to partner with districts that have received little training in the past but have counselors who are eager to learn and work toward college access and attainment goals. In Waukegan, for example, the counselors rarely have time to collaborate and share best practices. During our retreat, they had time to brainstorm, collaborate, and plan together. They left with clear, data-driven goals and ways to measure success, which they have already implemented. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drew Eder:&lt;/strong&gt; I believe the most important qualities of Professional Pathways are that the work is data-driven and the professional development is concentrated on the specific needs of the counseling staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the retreat, the Professional Pathways staff spends a half day with district counselors to complete a thorough needs assessment. This helps us build relationships and allows the retreat to be catered toward the needs of each counselor. Breakout session topics and speakers are chosen based on feedback from the group instead of assumed needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus on local data from each school is also valuable. Having disaggregated data to guide and focus discussion is imperative, as is allowing time for counselors to concentrate on their craft as a team and set measurable goals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: What are the biggest changes you’ve seen in the district — for counselors and for students — since launching Professional Pathways? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BG: &lt;/strong&gt;I have already seen and heard an empowerment in the department that was not as strong prior to this program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the initial phase of the program, we paired each Waukegan counselor up with an experienced counselor to work as a Professional Pathways “partner.” Each partner acts as someone to bounce ideas off and share best practices and professional development resources with. Many of the partners communicate regularly and have said that having a partner outside their district has opened up new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: What excites you most about this work? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BG:&lt;/strong&gt; I am most excited to see counselors feel like they have a voice and can make positive changes — even small ones — that will have a direct impact on their students’ college outcomes. I enjoy seeing counselors start to feel comfortable with the college search and application processes and have the confidence to implement changes in their practice. Seeing the counselors come together, brainstorm, and problem-solve is amazing, especially because they did not have many opportunities to do this in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am also excited about the level of support and interest through IACAC and beyond. We have 25 experienced counselors volunteering as partners for each of the Waukegan counselors, six dedicated committee members who plan the program, and 29 volunteers from high schools, colleges, and nonprofit organizations who helped run the retreat. Everyone is eager to help train and support this district, its counselors, and the students they serve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DE:&lt;/strong&gt; The most exciting part of the work for me was watching the counselors come together to create their action plans during the retreat. While the overnight part of the program added an expense, I believe it was the true difference-maker. People enjoyed each other’s company, laughed over dinner, and the fun atmosphere carried over to the work the next day; you could see people working as a team and problem-solving together. The extra time allowed counselors to let go of the work at school and focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: What advice would you give counselors interested in starting an initiative like this in their own communities? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BG:&lt;/strong&gt; Try it!  One thing I’ve learned is, even small changes can make great impacts. Take advantage of existing community resources and collaborate with community efforts. It’s important to have buy-in from the administration, so make sure you know the community and district and have concrete examples of how your program can positively affect their college access and attainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, most importantly, have a dedicated, passionate team in place.  It makes everything easier and more worthwhile in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DE:&lt;/strong&gt; Find a small group of dedicated professionals who want to mentor a group of counselors, and go for it! The support from our ACAC executive board was tremendous, and its approval for two years of funding was instrumental. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also owe a great deal to the team of counselors in California who originally ran this program and allowed us to “steal” it. They were incredible mentors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, don’t be afraid to make the program your own. We used some parts of the California model, but others were not applicable to us. Make it your own and give it a shot. Even if there are some bumps in the road, the impact on counselors and students will be tremendous!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Supporting Counselors to Support Students: Professional Pathways in IL &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Autumn Loss, a senior at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ublyschools.org/&quot;&gt;Ubly Community High School&lt;/a&gt; in Ubly, Michigan, has done what seemed impossible: she increased her &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sat.org/&quot;&gt;SAT&lt;/a&gt; score by 200 points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between taking the PSAT/NMSQT and the SAT, Autumn can tell you there was no expensive test prep involved, no mystery tricks to help her get the right answers. She simply practiced two to three times a week with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.satpractice.org/&quot;&gt;Official SAT Practice&lt;/a&gt;, the free, personalized, online SAT practice tools created through a partnership between Khan Academy and the College Board.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I loved that it gave me a broad range of questions I could practice,” said Autumn. “I could see my progress.” She practiced in class and outside of school, a few times a week, on the iPad Ubly Community provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy builds a personalized study plan for each student. By linking their College Board and Khan Academy accounts, they can use their scores from the SAT, &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/psat-nmsqt-psat-10&quot;&gt;PSAT/NMSQT, PSAT 10,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/psat-8-9&quot;&gt;PSAT 8/9&lt;/a&gt; to get personalized recommendations about what to learn next. In seconds, they get a&lt;span&gt;ccess to video lessons, full-length practice tests, thousands of interactive questions, and more. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official SAT Practice helped Autumn feel confident on test day because it focused her study time on the areas where she most needed to improve—in her case, in math—and demystified the format of the questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I struggled in math, and the videos made the problems easier to understand because they walked me through how they were worded,” she said. “I really liked the videos explaining the questions, so I could figure out the question on my own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For me, Official SAT practice was not only free, but also very convenient,” Autumn added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the tools became available in June 2016, more than 3.7 million users have logged on to practice for the SAT on Khan Academy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every one of the 270 students at Ubly Community High School has at some point or another logged onto Official SAT Practice in the last year. The teachers have integrated 30 minutes of practice on Khan Academy into their math and language arts classes each week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since we cover it in class every week, I think students understand this is important,” said Janice Brandel, a school counselor at Ubly Community. “I think students and teachers see a reason to pay attention, and there&#039;s a lot of buy-in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubly Community students not only take the PSAT/NMSQT and the SAT during the school day at no cost, but the PSAT 8/9 and PSAT 10 as well, which allows younger students to identify early on where they need to improve over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Brandel says that having access to free SAT preparation through Khan Academy opens doors for her students. While some may head to a trade school after graduation, taking the SAT gives them the chance to apply to college later if they change their minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t tell them you have to get this score or that score,” she said. “We tell students, we want you to do your best. Whatever your goals are, we don’t want you to have any barriers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fall, Autumn will head to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.delta.edu/&quot;&gt;Delta College&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.michigan.gov/mistudentaid/0,4636,7-128-60969_61016-274565--,00.html&quot;&gt;TIP&lt;/a&gt; scholarship. After two years, she plans to transfer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://msu.edu/&quot;&gt;Michigan State University&lt;/a&gt; and study agricultural education and natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;
