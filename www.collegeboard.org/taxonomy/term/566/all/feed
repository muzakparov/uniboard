&lt;p&gt;As part of our Access to Opportunity&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; program, the goal of All In is to enroll 100 percent of students who have demonstrated that they are likely to succeed in AP in at least one AP course.  Since December, we’ve reached out to parents, teachers, counselors, principals, and the students themselves to encourage those students to take at least one AP class next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, All In sent a letter to parents with a checklist of easy steps to help enroll their children in AP. In that letter, we asked parents to respond and let us know if they were interested in expanding AP opportunities not only for their children but for other African American, Latino, and Native American students in their communities. The response was heartening. Almost 1,000 parents indicated that they wanted to become involved in the work of the All In campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also reached parents by partnering with the Michele Stephenson and Joe Brewster, the filmmakers responsible for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/pov/americanpromise/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Promise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; documentary, by creating informational packets on African American male participation in AP. These packets were distributed at parties organized around the PBS airing of the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We contacted superintendents, principals, teachers, and counselors, asking them to be proactive in reaching out to students likely to succeed in AP to encourage them to take AP classes, and the reaction of these education professionals was also strong. The College Board’s Social Justice in-box was flooded with amazing stories about how these practitioners were able to dramatically increase AP enrollment among African American, Latino, and Native American students in their schools and districts. The overwhelming professional response prompted us to plan a webinar in April where educators shared their best All In practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have involved students not only through parents and school staff but also through our targeted social media and email campaigns. We were able to leverage the star power of Shonda Rhimes, creator of &lt;em&gt;Scandal &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Grey’s Anatomy, &lt;/em&gt;Richard Sherman of the Seattle Seahawks, and David Johns, executive director of the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans, who shared their AP experiences. All In’s targeted social media efforts on Twitter, Facebook, and Pandora brought over 10,000 visitors to our website. Students heard over and over again — from sources they trust — that they have not only the potential to succeed in AP classes but also the support of parents, teachers, counselors, and administrators to thrive in those classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, we were able to call a sample of the parents and students to whom we reached out via snail mail and email. The responses were encouraging. For example, of those contacted, 89 percent of the parents and 84 percent of the students were aware of the students’ AP potential. Eighty-six percent of the students and 81 percent of the parents said that they had already taken or would take the steps needed for AP class enrollment in the 2014-15 school year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a long way to go, and we look forward to continue moving the needle for high-performing African American, Latino, and Native American students.

    <title>Reflections on Meeting with Obama Administration Officials and Young Men of Color</title>

The young men — all successful AP&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Exam takers from the Washington, D.C., metro area — were there to share their experiences and insights with administration officials charged with overseeing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/my-brothers-keeper&quot;&gt;My Brother’s Keeper initiative&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The young men were remarkably thoughtful, well-spoken, honest, and often funny in recounting their stories. The stories they told reflected the full range of the American experience, touching on immigration, financial hardship, economically secure two-parent households, grave family illness, high-wealth suburban schools, and under-resourced city schools. The administration officials — all men of color themselves — engaged respectfully with the young men and shared their own backgrounds. And, if they were listening carefully, the officials heard the same themes that the All In program has identified through public opinion research: the critical role that adults who work in schools play in shaping students’ expectations for and of themselves; and the isolation that is often felt by high-achieving students of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maghan, in his opening remarks and throughout the two-hour meeting, deftly and repeatedly struck the “own your future” chord. Then he took it further, challenging the young men to not only own their own future but also embrace the responsibility of truly being their brother’s keeper. Being their brother’s keeper means reaching out to high-ability peers and encouraging them to take rigorous courses, and providing lowerclassmen with support. The young men responded to Maghan’s challenge, calling themselves “agents of my brother’s keeper,” and looked to the College Board to help them find ways to serve other young African American, Latino, and Native American men. We’ll keep you posted on how well we do in meeting their expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meeting was held in the Indian Treaty room of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building — a room sheathed in marble with a soaring ceiling — widely thought to be one of the grandest rooms in the White House complex. After the meeting, the young men viewed ever-grander and more historic rooms as they enjoyed a private tour of the White House. Some who lagged behind even caught a glimpse of Bo, the Obama family’s dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a day the young men will likely remember for a long time. Perhaps even more important, the officials who attended the meeting seem to have found it valuable — valuable enough that as the College Board group departed, there was talk of holding similar meetings in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following young men attended the October 27 meeting:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adrian Ernesto Jiminez&lt;/strong&gt;, Loudoun County High School&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Patrick Cuyjet&lt;/strong&gt;, W.T.

This applies to entering freshmen at Illinois public institutions of higher education beginning in the fall of 2016.&lt;span&gt;A statewide AP college credit policy helps ensure that public universities and colleges consistently and fairly recognize AP students’ academic achievement and simultaneously provides these institutions with an innovative solution to improve retention and decrease time to degree.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;For Illinois students, families and educators, this means greater access to AP and all the opportunities that go along with it. With HB 3428 signed into law, Illinois now will have a statewide Advanced Placement credit policy ensuring that students receive the college credits they can earn as a result of their hard work in AP. At a time when AP participation and performance has increased significantly in the state, this law provides more students with a greater opportunity to graduate college on time. A bipartisan group of public officials in Illinois worked for this result, including Governor Rauner and the bill sponsors: Representatives Carol Sente and Mike Fortner and Senator Pat McGuire.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the Governors of Virginia and Texas signed into law similar legislation. With the Illinois bill signing, 17 states now award college credit state-wide or system-wide to students earning scores of 3 and higher on AP Exams. Efforts are underway in other states, including in Colorado, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Growing Momentum for AP Credit Policies in the States&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Melanie Stambaugh, which requires the state’s public college and university system to establish a uniform policy of awarding college credit for Advanced Placement (AP) Exam scores of 3 or higher. Under current law, each institution is allowed to develop its own requirements for awarding credit, and some schools require higher scores than others. The new law takes effect this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.teachwithtvw.org/capitol-classroom/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Capitol Classroom&lt;/a&gt; who championed the bill throughout the legislative process were invited to witness the governor’s signing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The College Board thanks Washington officials and educators for their leadership in helping to ensure that students have the opportunity to receive the credits they’ve earned. Washington is the 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; state to enact a system-wide uniform AP credit policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Washington Establishes Statewide AP Credit Policy&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Susana Martinez and New Mexico Secretary of Education Hanna Skandera announced on April 28 that the College Board would be investing $1 million in the state’s AP program. Combined with the $750,000 in state funding that Martinez secured during the 2013 legislative session, this investment will go toward AP teacher preparation and recruitment, training counselors on how to guide students toward AP, and developing parent resources in several languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Based on data we’ve collected from those who have taken the PSAT, we have thousands of New Mexico students not taking AP courses in high school who could further their education and save thousands of dollars by doing so,” said Martinez. “Access to AP courses can be particularly limited in rural areas, and I’m appreciative that the College Board is providing funding to help us expand access to college-ready classes for students throughout our communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement was made during the Native American Student Advocacy Institute (NASAI), an event hosted annually by the College Board that brings together leaders from Native American communities to discuss issues affecting their students around the country. The governor’s announcement particularly resonated with conference participants, who discussed the issue of expanding access to AP for Native students in several sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colloquium session titled “Delivering Opportunity via the Advanced Placement Program&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;” took a pointed look at the lack of AP access for Native American students even amid the growing representation of other minority groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re proud of our students and teachers as they continue to make New Mexico a national leader in AP courses,” said Martinez. “When we set a high standard for our students, they always rise to the challenge. Thanks to our educators and support from the College Board, our students are not only saving millions on tuition expenses but also better prepared for college-level courses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Mexico is just one of several states that have significantly increased their funding for AP in the past five years. The Georgia Department of Education allocated $1.3 million for the 2012-13 school year to pay for one AP Exam for every student who qualified for free or reduced-price lunch. In 2012, the Texas Legislature enabled the Texas Education Agency to put $30 toward the test fee for each AP Exam taken by Texas students.&lt;/p&gt;

I teach in a low-income, urban school about five miles north of Boston. About 80% of my students receive free or reduced lunch, meaning they live at or below the poverty level, and many are English language learners. In the past few years, enrollment has dropped off significantly in AP Literature for a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possible reason is that my school operates on a four period block schedule, and students are limited in the number of AP classes they can take. Perhaps the largest factor is the strong drive for students to enroll in STEM courses. That, coupled with the economic and governmental push for students to enter STEM fields, has resulted in an increased number of students taking AP math and science courses. Further, there exists a mistaken notion that &quot;you only take AP Lit if you want to be an English teacher.&quot; Students don&#039;t seem to understand the value of taking AP Literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I believe that the significance of taking STEM courses in today&#039;s world is enormous, I also firmly believe that a strong foundation in the humanities will serve students well no matter what field they enter. The ability to read and write well is essential to any career. In fact, I&#039;d argue that a course like Advanced Placement Literature and Composition is one of the most important classes a student can take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, I needed to communicate this to my students. I wanted them to find a balance in their lives that would truly make them college and career ready. I decided the best way to share this information was through the words of my former students. So I took to Facebook and emailed my former students, who were now working in successful careers that ran the gamut from biochemical engineer to market research analyst. I asked these former students to articulate the value of a course like Advanced Placement Literature and Composition, and this is what some of them said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hina&lt;/strong&gt; is now an attending physician and clinical instructor. She attended Wellesley College, where she majored in Biological Chemistry and minored in Religion. She went on to Cornell School of Medicine. Hina stated, &quot;&lt;em&gt;AP English was one of my favorite high school courses. Today I work as an emergency room doctor. Taking AP English has made me well-rounded and has fostered an appreciation of the humanities that is critical to a full intellectual life. I feel I am a better doctor - and a fuller person - as a result of taking AP English.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morris&lt;/strong&gt;, now an Asset Manager, received his B.S. in Communications from Boston College. &quot;&lt;em&gt;Of all the high school classes I took, the skills I gained from AP English were of the most use to me after high school, through college, and for my career,” he stated. “Critically digesting information, formulating original opinions, and expressing those thoughts clearly and concisely, are all invaluable everyday life skills.  Not to mention, being able to think on my feet has saved my tail countless times during executive meetings!&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rob&lt;/strong&gt; is a Lead Systems Engineer at General Electric. He received his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute and his MBA from Quinnipiac. Rob told me, &quot;&lt;em&gt;I was reluctant to at first to take AP Literature because I knew I was going on to pursue a career in science. Few classes and teachers have challenged me intellectually the same way I was challenged that year. AP Lit forced me to think analytically and critically. These are the cornerstones of problem solving, and they form the foundation for a career in science. The class helped increase my proficiency in writing exponentially, giving me an inherent advantage over my peers that exists to this day. Whereas most math and science students lacked a solid background in writing, I had ample experience. With increasing competition for jobs in the business world, the ability to effectively and coherently communicate thoughts and ideas is a differentiator, regardless of the field you pursue.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a sampling of the wonderful replies I received. I gathered about twenty of the responses, typed them up, and printed them out with photos of each former student. I then mounted them on poster board, laminated them, and created a &quot;Why Take AP Literature and Composition&quot; bulletin board right outside my room. Every time I see a student reading the responses, I have to smile. I also created a booklet which featured each former student&#039;s story, and I distributed it to parents and prospective students on AP Information Night. And I brought Rob in to speak to the families, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AP Lit numbers jumped from 16 students last year to 32 students this year. I am fairly certain the powerful words of former RHS students compelled some of these new students to see the value in taking the course. As we endeavor to increase enrollment and provide equity and access for all in our AP courses, the voices of our former students can be strong motivators, which reflect the value of exploring rigorous curriculum in high school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Former AP® Student Voices = Increased AP Numbers&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The PSAT/NMSQT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, SAT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, and AP&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Exams always have been opportunity assessments, linking students to scholarships, college admission, and course credit. Anchored in the belief that students today need more opportunities — not more tests — the College Board has redesigned these exams and connected them to a wider array of educational and scholarship benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students taking the PSAT/NMSQT will have increased access to money for college through the College Board’s partnership with five of the country’s leading scholarship providers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students taking the redesigned SAT can benefit from free, personalized, interactive practice tools on KhanAcademy.org.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The AP Program has partnered with college professors and AP teachers nationwide to create new AP courses in critical STEM fields, while partnering with states to enact uniform credit policies that will help ensure that students receive the college credits they have earned through AP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PSAT/NMSQT, SAT, and AP results provide valuable information that can help ensure that more students graduate from high school ready for college and career. To support&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;decision-makers in using these results to effect change for students, the College Board has outlined three strategies to improve access and performance, bolster college graduation rates, and further increase participation in STEM course work. These strategies are part of the College Board’s ongoing commitment to connect assessments with opportunities that help more students make successful transitions to college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need fewer tests that do more,” said College Board President David Coleman. “We’re seeing great momentum through the wide and growing range of opportunities that our assessments provide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are highlights from the &lt;em&gt;2015 Program Results&lt;/em&gt; and the recommended strategies to support educators and students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Access and Participation &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding access to actionable assessments and challenging course work is an important way to connect students to college and career opportunities. Significant gains were made in access to the three College Board programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PSAT/NMSQT: Record number of test-takers. &lt;/strong&gt;In the fall of 2014, a record 3.8 million students took the PSAT/NMSQT, up from 3.7 million in 2013 and 3.6 million in 2010.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAT: Growing participation.&lt;/strong&gt; A record 1.7 million students from the class of 2015 took the SAT, compared to 1.67 million students from the graduating class of 2014 and 1.65 million in the class of 2011. A total of 25.1 percent of SAT takers in the class of 2015 took the exam using a fee waiver, compared to 23.6 percent in the class of 2014 and 21.3 percent in the class of 2011.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AP: Record number of students takes AP Exams. &lt;/strong&gt;2.5 million students took an AP Exam in 2015, compared to 2.3 million in 2014 and just under 2 million in 2011.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Performance and Success&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased access to assessments can help educators monitor student progress, understand skill areas in need of improvement, and identify students’ potential to succee in challenging course work. Results from the PSAT/NMSQT are the best predictor of a student’s potential to succeed in certain AP courses. &lt;strong&gt;In 2014-15, about 520,000 10th-grade PSAT/NMSQT takers overall showed potential to succeed in at least one AP course.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AP courses offer students the opportunity to pursue college-level course work while still in high school. Students who succeed on AP Exams are more likely than other students to graduate from college on time, and they have the potential to save time and money through placement and credit-granting policies. &lt;strong&gt;More than 1.5 million students received a score of 3 or higher on an AP Exam in 2015, compared to 1.4 million in 2014 and 1.2 million in 2011.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assessment results also can inform whether students are on track for college and career readiness.&lt;strong&gt; Nearly 766,000 (48 percent) of 11th-grade PSAT/NMSQT takers met the grade-level benchmark, indicating they are on track for college and career readiness. &lt;/strong&gt;In addition, these results can help educators and policymakers see areas of progress and growth, as well as areas for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SAT is a proven and trusted indicator of college readiness and success for students from all backgrounds. &lt;strong&gt;More than 712,000 students (41.9 percent of SAT takers in the class of 2015) met the SAT College and Career Readiness Benchmark. &lt;/strong&gt;High school graduates who reach the benchmark are more likely to enroll in a four-year college and graduate on time than those who do not meet the benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Solutions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the results, the College Board has highlighted three ways in which education leaders and policymakers can help propel students toward college and career opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage more students to think about higher education and participate in the college-going process&lt;/strong&gt;. With the support of states and districts, &lt;strong&gt;SAT School Day&lt;/strong&gt; allows juniors and seniors to take the SAT in their schools on a regular school day and avoids common complications of Saturday testing — such as part-time jobs, family responsibilities, and finding transportation. To date, all states that have made this commitment to access have seen growth in the number of students meeting the benchmark and gaining access to college.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Said Chief of Assessment Cyndie Schmeiser: “We are excited that more students are participating in SAT School Day because of all the benefits that come with it. By removing common barriers for students — like transportation or weekend work commitments — we are able to foster a college-going culture and increase access to college, especially among first-generation college-bound students. Through our assessments, we’re connecting students to opportunity with college application fee waivers and free personalized practice with Khan Academy, thereby encouraging more students to pursue a college education.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help students make the most of their college experience and graduate in four years&lt;/strong&gt;. The AP Program enlists and encourages talented teachers, provides exciting,in-depth classroom experiences, and gives students the opportunity to master challenging subject matter that often is related to their choice of a college major. &lt;strong&gt;A statewide AP college credit policy &lt;/strong&gt;helps ensure that public universities and colleges consistently and fairly recognize AP students’ academic achievements and simultaneously provides these institutions with an innovative solution to improve retention and decrease time to degree. As of August 2015, 17 states — most recently Illinois, Texas, and Virginia — have implemented unified and consistent statewide or systemwide AP policies to ensure that students’ achievements are equitably recognized.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure that more students are inspired and prepared to become the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) professionals our nation needs. &lt;/strong&gt;According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the need for jobs in science, technology, engineering, and math is expected to increase by 13 percent between 2012 and 2022 (versus 11 percent growth for all occupations). As a nation, we are not graduating nearly enough STEM majors to meet this need. Research shows that students who take AP math and science courses are more likely than non-AP students to earn degrees in physical science, engineering, and life science disciplines. To address this need, &lt;strong&gt;the AP Program has expanded its STEM offerings&lt;/strong&gt;. In 2014-15, their inaugural year, AP Physics 1 and 2 showed the largest growth of any courses in the history of AP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Senior Vice President of AP and Instruction Trevor Packer said: “We believe that inspiring and preparing students for in-demand STEM careers is an important opportunity for AP math and science courses. The launch of the AP Physics 1 and 2 courses this year attracted nearly double the number of high school students to enroll in algebra-based AP Physics classes, and demand for AP Computer Science A and our forthcoming AP Computer Science Principles is high. These results show that America’s students are eager to take on the challenge of STEM.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;A Look Forward&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the College Board announced it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;redesign&lt;/a&gt; the SAT and PSAT/NMSQT and introduce the PSAT&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; 10 and PSAT 8/9&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; to focus on the skills that recent data show matter most for success in college and career. A parallel focus on depth over breadth has been informing the redesign of AP course frameworks and exams so that teachers and students gain more time to develop the knowledge and skills required in college course work. The redesigned courses and assessments will launch on a rolling basis. Redesigned courses and exams in &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/arts-and-world-languages/art-history&quot;&gt;AP Art History&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/english-history-and-social-science/european-history&quot;&gt;AP European History&lt;/a&gt;, along with a new course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/ap-capstone/ap-research&quot;&gt;AP Capstone&lt;sup&gt;™ &lt;/sup&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt;, are in place for the 2015-16 school year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first administrations of the PSAT/NMSQT and PSAT 8/9 will take place in October 2015, and the first administrations of the PSAT 10 and SAT will be given in March 2016. Working with College Board members and partners, the redesigned assessments will connect students to more opportunities than ever before, including fee waivers for assessments and college applications, increased access to more scholarships, and free, personalized practice tools on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;KhanAcademy.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;2015 College Board Program Results Show More Students Taking Challenging Courses, Need to Improve Readiness Remains&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

As participants in the NYC Department of Education’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://schools.nyc.gov/Offices/mediarelations/NewsandSpeeches/2015-2016/Arts+Matters.htm&quot;&gt;Arts Matter&lt;/a&gt; initiative, these public school principals, teachers, and coordinators build robust arts programs in historically under-served schools throughout the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman opened his remarks with the words of legendary dancer and choreographer Martha Graham. “I believe that we learn by practice,” Coleman said, invoking Graham’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://thisibelieve.org/essay/16583/&quot;&gt;This I Believe&lt;/a&gt;” essay, and described how artists endure difficult, focused, sometimes even painful practice to make great work. They get frustrated, they fail. They iterate often. They revise over and over again. And yet through these efforts, they find beauty, grace, and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But what does this activity of the soul have to do with the College Board?” Coleman asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board’s commitment to arts reverberates through its Advanced Placement arts programs. In 2015, more than 80,000 students took AP art exams, in subjects ranging from art history to studio art to music theory. And it was the community of educators around these students, said Coleman, that enabled them to excel — giving them space to express themselves, to make and revise work, to practice, to assemble strong portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is only one force that has changed student performance at scale in this country, and that is a great teacher,” Coleman declared. “The only technology we know that can really help our students grow is teachers like you.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, he admitted, the College Board has to do more. It is simply not enough to offer AP arts courses — we must also provide equal access to the tools that make high-quality arts instruction and learning possible. “We must make the tools of practice free,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, Coleman was pleased to share information about the College Board’s collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://smarthistory.org/&quot;&gt;Smarthistory&lt;/a&gt;, an online multimedia resource for the study of art and cultural heritage. As of this year, Smarthistory has more than 200 vetted contributors (art historians, archeologists, curators, and academics) and features more than 1,500 essays and videos. This content is freely available to a global audience, and it delves into nearly all of the works covered in the AP Art History course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the College Board celebrated the arts during the second annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/academic/winners-second-atlantic-and-college-board-writing-prize-contest&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; College Board Writing Prize&lt;/a&gt;. This year’s contest asked high school students to submit essays that insightfully analyzed and interpreted a work of art that made an impression on them. Over 2,000 students from 43 countries submitted essays on more than 700 paintings, sculptures, and drawings. The award-winning essays, Coleman said, highlighted both the power and the importance of students being able to express their understanding of artistic works through writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For students to be recognized for their work in the arts,” he said, “they must be able to write about them.” By coupling arts instruction and writing instruction, arts teachers best position their students to thoughtfully engage with — and show their aptitude in — the arts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To close his keynote, Coleman made one point clear: “There’s no doubt arts education is important and beneficial for college and career readiness. The College Board speaks to schools all across the country to make sure the arts have their rightful place. But I think we as educators have to pause. We need to confess and declare that education is not just about preparing for college and careers. It is a soul craft.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the arts teachers present, he continued: “The work you do every day with your students surpasses the values of this earth — it moves into deep questions about how fully students live their lives and how fully they can express their deepest experiences. At the College Board we believe those values are essential, they are worth investing in, and they are deeply valuable to students’ futures — inside and outside the classroom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;The Arts Matter&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the full letter: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November 19, 2014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Colleague:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a country, we are leaving far too much talent on the table. Too many high achieving African American, Latino, and Native American students — students who have demonstrated the potential to do well in Advanced Placement® (AP®) courses — are not enrolling in those courses. This is an enormous missed opportunity for them and for all of us working for a stronger, fairer, and more secure nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ground that’s been gained for these students has largely been the result of the inspired and dogged work of superintendents, school board members, staff, and teachers in our major cities. The new partnership between the Council of the Great City Schools, the College Board, and the White House — through its My Brother’s Keeper initiative — aims to bolster the good work already under way, share lessons learned as broadly as possible, and dramatically increase the proportion of students of color with AP potential who are enrolled in AP courses. We are pleased to announce that the National Council of La Raza, the National Urban League, and The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights will also be joining us in this effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real success of this effort depends on you, your schools, counselors, and teachers. Success — we have learned from leading districts — is a dynamic mixture of good data and human interaction. Without the data, we can’t effectively target outreach and resources. The College Board’s AP Potential™ tool provides critical information about which students have demonstrated — by their performance on the PSAT/NMSQT® — potential to succeed in AP. PSAT/NMSQT scores often uncover academic ability that might otherwise be overlooked, and they spotlight those students ready to be successful in AP. And in focus group after focus group, these students tell us that the single most important factor in their decision to take an AP class was the support and encouragement from adults in their school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are in the strongest position to make a difference — by establishing a clear districtwide priority, by setting public goals for improvement, by monitoring progress at individual schools, and by providing guidance and support to your principals as they encourage students with AP potential to take these courses. We at the College Board and the Council of the Great City Schools have found our collaboration to be invaluable, and we believe that you will too. We have asked the College Board’s regional vice presidents to set up meetings in December with each of you. The purpose of these meetings is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review the PSAT/NMSQT data for your districts and schools;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set goals for improving AP enrollment of African American, Native American, and Latino students this spring;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify needs that your district will have in meeting these goals; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assess how the College Board and the Council can help you meet these goals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For reference, we are including a possible agenda for these meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next couple of weeks, a member of the College Board staff will be in touch with you about setting up an initial meeting. In the interim, we invite you to view this webinar about the steps you can take to propel our students forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you will consider sharing it with the principals and counselors in your district as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or need any additional information, please feel free to reach out to Amy Wilkins (&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:awilkins@collegeboard.org&quot;&gt;awilkins@collegeboard.org&lt;/a&gt;) or Ray Hart (&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:rhart@cgcs.org&quot;&gt;rhart@cgcs.org&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Casserly&lt;/strong&gt;, Executive Director of the Council of the Great City Schools and &lt;strong&gt;David Coleman&lt;/strong&gt;, President and CEO of the College Board&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Letter to CGCS Superintendents from David Coleman and Michael Casserly&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the frequency of its use to the high stakes attached to it, standardized testing is among the biggest hot-button topics in education today. The number of educators and families disputing its necessity has only risen over the years, with the last few years seeing a spike in the number of students opting out of participating in their states&#039; annual tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may come as some surprise that one of the first people who will admit that the current testing model is broken is also at the helm of the company that produces some of the biggest tests in K-12 and higher ed, the Advanced Placement and SAT exams. But according to College Board President and CEO David Coleman, &quot;Assessment without opportunity is dead. We don&#039;t need more tests. We need more opportunities.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Everything I&#039;ve seen convinces me that assessments alone don&#039;t solve problems,&quot; he told a packed theater at the New York Times Schools For Tomorrow Conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite admissions officers frequently citing the SAT&#039;s ability to help identify &quot;diamonds in the rough,&quot; data shows more than half of high-achieving low-income students taking the exam don&#039;t apply to highly selective schools. On the AP front, 14 states had no Hispanic or black exam-takers, and less than 20% women taking the AP Computer Science exam in 2010.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;We hoped assessment would level the playing field, but found that a test-prep industry arose that fostered the perception that testing merely recapitulates the inequalities tearing our society apart,&quot; Coleman said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For Coleman, it&#039;s not enough for College Board to say problems like inequities in course access, test-prep, and performance aren&#039;t their fault. &quot;It may not be our fault, but it is our problem.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, the company has detailed four rules for assessments that advance opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Assess only what students learn in the classroom and will use again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman illustrated this rule by asking the audience to consider SAT words, which might be defined as words a test-taker likely hadn&#039;t heard before and won&#039;t likely hear again. &quot;In fact, they&#039;re called SAT words because the only place you can reliably find them is on an SAT. But that&#039;s not OK.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, students shouldn&#039;t have to learn things simply because they&#039;re on a test, but because those things will have lasting value to their life and future success. For that reason, the SAT no longer has &quot;SAT words&quot; and instead features words (i.e. synthesis, analysis) that students will use numerous times throughout college coursework and career training. Additionally, the exam narrowed its math focus instead of trying to cover the topic in a manner that was &quot;a mile wide and an inch deep.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Ensure all students claim the opportunities they&#039;ve earned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixing the test was just the first step, Coleman said. When examining why low-income high-achievers didn&#039;t apply to highly selective colleges, College Board found that one major hindrance was application fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working with colleges, the company is now able to provide four fee waivers to all low-income students taking the SAT. In Advanced Placement, College Board has also launched an &quot;all-in&quot; campaign to improve the number of black and Latino students taking exams. In 2015, Coleman said, the number of states lacking black or Latino AP Computer Science exam takers was down to one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Assessments must earn students and families something worthwhile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students shouldn&#039;t be told to take a test &quot;because they have to,&quot; Coleman said. &quot;Students don&#039;t buy it, teachers don&#039;t buy it, and, increasingly, parents don&#039;t buy it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Advanced Placement, he said, students and teachers have an exact reason for why they&#039;re working hard: college credit. For that reason, the PSAT also now carries an additional $180 million in scholarship opportunities as part of College Board&#039;s partnerships with National Merit, the United Negro College Fund, the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, and the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Remember what assessments can&#039;t do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, Coleman told those gathered, is the most important rule because it hinges on the work students and teachers do every day. &quot;The only things that change performance are productive practice and great courses.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further assist in-class efforts, the College Board also partnered with Khan Academy to provide free test prep courses worldwide. The site launched this summer and has already been used by hundreds of thousands of unique users, who have solved over four million problems, according to Coleman. Additional partnerships with the Boys &amp;amp; Girls Clubs are meant to further ensure access to this material. For students who primarily only have Internet access via smartphone, the company is enabling them to take paper-and-pencil practice exams, which they can then snap a photo of and send over for grading and personal practice recommendations from Khan Academy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond making top-quality test prep free and equal, however, Coleman stresses the importance of daily work in class with teachers, using high-quality curriculum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&#039;s time to stop lecturing folks that assessments are worth it and to prove it,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;In the News: How the College Board changed its standardized testing approach&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;On September 14, 2016, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy held a Summit on Computer Science (CS) for All. &lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/01/30/computer-science-all&quot;&gt;CS for All&lt;/a&gt; leverages new and existing efforts to promote and scale computer science education in every community in America. Learning computer science prepares students to successfully participate in our technology-driven world. (You can watch a recording of the Summit on CS for All &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiZLuHfvvYI&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was invited to speak at the Summit on CS for All to announce the launch of the new AP Computer Science Principles course. More than 2,000 schools have indicated they are offering the course to roughly 25,000 students this fall, making it the largest AP course launch ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AP Computer Science Principles was designed with the goal of creating leaders in computer science fields and attracting and engaging diverse populations of students. Not only is AP Computer Science Principles a rigorous course, but it also introduces essential computer science concepts in relevant contexts. It aims to appeal to underrepresented groups, including females and students of color, by giving students opportunities to use computer science to address real-world issues and gain skills relevant across other disciplines and industries. Students learn to create programs or technologies that have practical impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional development for educators is necessary to expanding AP Computer Science Principles. To that end, the AP Program hosted more than 70 AP Summer Institutes in 2016, training 1,400 teachers. The Program has also endorsed five curriculum and professional development providers to ensure that schools and teachers have high-quality options for implementing AP Computer Science Principles. You can find these resources (and learn how they were selected) &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/stem/computer-science-principles/curricula-pedagogical-support&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board appreciates the support of—and our collaboration with—the National Science Foundation during the development of AP Computer Science Principles, as well as the hundreds of secondary and post-secondary educators who piloted and helped develop the course at their institutions. We couldn’t have done it without their dedication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One AP Computer Science Principles teacher, Art Lopez,  especially embraced this opportunity to bring computer science to his school, Sweetwater High School, a low-income school south of San Diego, CA, and his district. He was a pilot teacher for several years, and during that time he helped prepare teachers from eleven other high schools in Sweetwater Union District to teach AP Computer Science Principles at their own schools this fall. In his class, students learn to solve problems, collaborate, and express their solutions with the computer programs they write. As a testament to his efforts, one of his students, Karla Gonzales, said, “Taking the Computer Science Principles course changed my perspective of school and about myself. I truly believe computer science is a valuable course in a student’s academic career. Not many courses can teach creativity like computer science can.” The course gave Gonzales more self-confidence as she honed in on the creative aspects, and it encouraged her to pursue a degree in computer science, which she is now doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our economy changes and the number of jobs requiring a computer science background increases, there’s a pressing need to recognize the importance of computer science education. AP Computer Science Principles helps students learn how they can apply computer science knowledge and skills to a broad range of fields and interests, including science, technology, engineering, art, mathematics (STEAM) and other computing disciplines.  Armed with such skills, students will have broader prospects for social mobility in our country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;AP Computer Science Principles Celebrated at White House Summit&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;When you hear the words “computer science,” do you imagine someone sitting in front of a computer alone, typing code all day and night? Think again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaila Piscitelli was a student at Conrad High School in Connecticut when she created an app that recommends clothes a traveler should pack based on weather forecasts. Her classmate, Lily Sientab, built an app that teaches younger students the alphabet. Hamed Nassaco—who attended the Academy for Software Engineering in New York—uses computer code to write songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These students brought their ideas to life in AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP). This new Advanced Placement course from the College Board invites students—even those with no previous coding or programming experience—to use computing tools and skills to pursue their own interests, showcase their creativity, and address real-world issues in their community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like other Advanced Placement courses, AP CSP is a college-level course students can take while in high school. The framework for each AP course is created by a panel of experts and college-level educators from each specific field of study. American colleges and universities may grant placement and course credit to students who get qualifying scores on AP Exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning the basics of computer science can lead to hundreds of career choices, from engineering, law, and medicine to animation, visual arts, and music. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that more than nine million STEM jobs will open up over the next decade, and half of those will require a computing background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, through our own research, the College Board has learned that many students who have the potential to succeed in advanced computer science coursework never seize that opportunity—especially female, African American, and Latino students. And we know from the National Science Foundation—a partner in our AP CSP work—that the number of women graduating with computer science degrees is nearly half of what it was in the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By broadening the invitation, and working with our partners at Code.org, Project Lead the Way, states like Kentucky, and districts across the country, we’re working to make computer science education much more widely available to young women, students of color, and students in rural communities. More than 2,500 schools offered AP CSP this fall, and 350 colleges and counting award college credit and placement to students who pass their AP CSP Exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All students deserve access to the technology and skills they&#039;ll need to succeed in the future. Studying computer science is about using one elaborate tool to solve real-life problems, creatively and collaboratively. In the words of one AP CSP teacher from California, Art Lopez: “If you learn about computer science, you have the ability to change the world.” Lily Sientab, the alphabet-teaching app designer, agrees. “This class is about taking your own ideas and implementing them to create something new. Computer science has shown me that I can try, and try again, and actually accomplish what I set my mind to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
