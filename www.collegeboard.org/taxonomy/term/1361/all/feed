&lt;p&gt;The PSAT/NMSQT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, SAT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, and AP&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Exams always have been opportunity assessments, linking students to scholarships, college admission, and course credit. Anchored in the belief that students today need more opportunities — not more tests — the College Board has redesigned these exams and connected them to a wider array of educational and scholarship benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students taking the PSAT/NMSQT will have increased access to money for college through the College Board’s partnership with five of the country’s leading scholarship providers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students taking the redesigned SAT can benefit from free, personalized, interactive practice tools on KhanAcademy.org.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The AP Program has partnered with college professors and AP teachers nationwide to create new AP courses in critical STEM fields, while partnering with states to enact uniform credit policies that will help ensure that students receive the college credits they have earned through AP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PSAT/NMSQT, SAT, and AP results provide valuable information that can help ensure that more students graduate from high school ready for college and career. To support&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;decision-makers in using these results to effect change for students, the College Board has outlined three strategies to improve access and performance, bolster college graduation rates, and further increase participation in STEM course work. These strategies are part of the College Board’s ongoing commitment to connect assessments with opportunities that help more students make successful transitions to college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need fewer tests that do more,” said College Board President David Coleman. “We’re seeing great momentum through the wide and growing range of opportunities that our assessments provide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are highlights from the &lt;em&gt;2015 Program Results&lt;/em&gt; and the recommended strategies to support educators and students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Access and Participation &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding access to actionable assessments and challenging course work is an important way to connect students to college and career opportunities. Significant gains were made in access to the three College Board programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PSAT/NMSQT: Record number of test-takers. &lt;/strong&gt;In the fall of 2014, a record 3.8 million students took the PSAT/NMSQT, up from 3.7 million in 2013 and 3.6 million in 2010.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAT: Growing participation.&lt;/strong&gt; A record 1.7 million students from the class of 2015 took the SAT, compared to 1.67 million students from the graduating class of 2014 and 1.65 million in the class of 2011. A total of 25.1 percent of SAT takers in the class of 2015 took the exam using a fee waiver, compared to 23.6 percent in the class of 2014 and 21.3 percent in the class of 2011.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AP: Record number of students takes AP Exams. &lt;/strong&gt;2.5 million students took an AP Exam in 2015, compared to 2.3 million in 2014 and just under 2 million in 2011.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Performance and Success&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased access to assessments can help educators monitor student progress, understand skill areas in need of improvement, and identify students’ potential to succee in challenging course work. Results from the PSAT/NMSQT are the best predictor of a student’s potential to succeed in certain AP courses. &lt;strong&gt;In 2014-15, about 520,000 10th-grade PSAT/NMSQT takers overall showed potential to succeed in at least one AP course.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AP courses offer students the opportunity to pursue college-level course work while still in high school. Students who succeed on AP Exams are more likely than other students to graduate from college on time, and they have the potential to save time and money through placement and credit-granting policies. &lt;strong&gt;More than 1.5 million students received a score of 3 or higher on an AP Exam in 2015, compared to 1.4 million in 2014 and 1.2 million in 2011.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assessment results also can inform whether students are on track for college and career readiness.&lt;strong&gt; Nearly 766,000 (48 percent) of 11th-grade PSAT/NMSQT takers met the grade-level benchmark, indicating they are on track for college and career readiness. &lt;/strong&gt;In addition, these results can help educators and policymakers see areas of progress and growth, as well as areas for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SAT is a proven and trusted indicator of college readiness and success for students from all backgrounds. &lt;strong&gt;More than 712,000 students (41.9 percent of SAT takers in the class of 2015) met the SAT College and Career Readiness Benchmark. &lt;/strong&gt;High school graduates who reach the benchmark are more likely to enroll in a four-year college and graduate on time than those who do not meet the benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Solutions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the results, the College Board has highlighted three ways in which education leaders and policymakers can help propel students toward college and career opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage more students to think about higher education and participate in the college-going process&lt;/strong&gt;. With the support of states and districts, &lt;strong&gt;SAT School Day&lt;/strong&gt; allows juniors and seniors to take the SAT in their schools on a regular school day and avoids common complications of Saturday testing — such as part-time jobs, family responsibilities, and finding transportation. To date, all states that have made this commitment to access have seen growth in the number of students meeting the benchmark and gaining access to college.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Said Chief of Assessment Cyndie Schmeiser: “We are excited that more students are participating in SAT School Day because of all the benefits that come with it. By removing common barriers for students — like transportation or weekend work commitments — we are able to foster a college-going culture and increase access to college, especially among first-generation college-bound students. Through our assessments, we’re connecting students to opportunity with college application fee waivers and free personalized practice with Khan Academy, thereby encouraging more students to pursue a college education.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help students make the most of their college experience and graduate in four years&lt;/strong&gt;. The AP Program enlists and encourages talented teachers, provides exciting,in-depth classroom experiences, and gives students the opportunity to master challenging subject matter that often is related to their choice of a college major. &lt;strong&gt;A statewide AP college credit policy &lt;/strong&gt;helps ensure that public universities and colleges consistently and fairly recognize AP students’ academic achievements and simultaneously provides these institutions with an innovative solution to improve retention and decrease time to degree. As of August 2015, 17 states — most recently Illinois, Texas, and Virginia — have implemented unified and consistent statewide or systemwide AP policies to ensure that students’ achievements are equitably recognized.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure that more students are inspired and prepared to become the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) professionals our nation needs. &lt;/strong&gt;According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the need for jobs in science, technology, engineering, and math is expected to increase by 13 percent between 2012 and 2022 (versus 11 percent growth for all occupations). As a nation, we are not graduating nearly enough STEM majors to meet this need. Research shows that students who take AP math and science courses are more likely than non-AP students to earn degrees in physical science, engineering, and life science disciplines. To address this need, &lt;strong&gt;the AP Program has expanded its STEM offerings&lt;/strong&gt;. In 2014-15, their inaugural year, AP Physics 1 and 2 showed the largest growth of any courses in the history of AP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Senior Vice President of AP and Instruction Trevor Packer said: “We believe that inspiring and preparing students for in-demand STEM careers is an important opportunity for AP math and science courses. The launch of the AP Physics 1 and 2 courses this year attracted nearly double the number of high school students to enroll in algebra-based AP Physics classes, and demand for AP Computer Science A and our forthcoming AP Computer Science Principles is high. These results show that America’s students are eager to take on the challenge of STEM.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;A Look Forward&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the College Board announced it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;redesign&lt;/a&gt; the SAT and PSAT/NMSQT and introduce the PSAT&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; 10 and PSAT 8/9&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; to focus on the skills that recent data show matter most for success in college and career. A parallel focus on depth over breadth has been informing the redesign of AP course frameworks and exams so that teachers and students gain more time to develop the knowledge and skills required in college course work. The redesigned courses and assessments will launch on a rolling basis. Redesigned courses and exams in &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/arts-and-world-languages/art-history&quot;&gt;AP Art History&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/english-history-and-social-science/european-history&quot;&gt;AP European History&lt;/a&gt;, along with a new course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/ap-capstone/ap-research&quot;&gt;AP Capstone&lt;sup&gt;™ &lt;/sup&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt;, are in place for the 2015-16 school year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first administrations of the PSAT/NMSQT and PSAT 8/9 will take place in October 2015, and the first administrations of the PSAT 10 and SAT will be given in March 2016. Working with College Board members and partners, the redesigned assessments will connect students to more opportunities than ever before, including fee waivers for assessments and college applications, increased access to more scholarships, and free, personalized practice tools on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;KhanAcademy.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;2015 College Board Program Results Show More Students Taking Challenging Courses, Need to Improve Readiness Remains&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

It’s just one of the ways the new SAT is leveling the playing field and making it easier for students to show their best work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, more than four million students received their scores from the October 2016 PSAT/NMSQT. Every one of those students now has access to a free, customized SAT practice plan on &lt;a href=&quot;file://nyodska01/aelwell/Link%20Day/satpractice.org&quot;&gt;Official SAT Practice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 18, students can help even more of their peers get ready for the SAT, simply by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIkCoQoZ21U&quot;&gt;connecting their College Board and Khan Academy accounts and sending their 2016 PSAT/NMSQT results to Khan Academy&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll donate laptops to libraries in the district* with the highest percentage of 2016 PSAT/NMSQT test takers who connect their accounts between &lt;strong&gt;October 1, 2016, and January 18, 2017&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; in the three districts* with the highest percentage who connect accounts any time on &lt;strong&gt;January 18&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help us spread the word! Tell your friends and family about this effort to make sure all students have access to the tools they need to get ready for the SAT. You can use the following language to share the news on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daily Practice for the New SAT is now available for iOS and will be available for Android within two weeks. It includes some relatively standard stuff that SAT readiness apps do:  there’s a question of the day for the new SAT that students can work on to stay fresh.  We’ve innovated here, providing a way for students to batch download questions so that they don’t have to complete questions in drips. The questions themselves are also much higher quality than you’d get on a similar app from another provider, but fundamentally this is still business as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the Daily Practice app blazes ahead is with the Scan + Score feature.  For the first time in test prep history, students will now be able to take a picture of their answer sheet and receive scores instantly. Beyond just the scores, they’ll also be able to see their performance on each question with detailed answer explanations. The results will be linked to students’ individual College Board accounts,  so they  can link their College Board and Khan Academy accounts (available in December) to receive  personalized instructional recommendations based on the practice test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen percent of low-income households rely on a smartphone for their sole source of internet access.  Daily Practice for the New SAT will take technology’s promise of personalization and marry it with the tried and true accessibility of paper-and-pencil testing.  With free practice tests available for download or from their counselor’s office, now &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; students can benefit from the personalization that technology provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, as David Coleman said, “The Daily Practice for the New SAT app is a remarkable tool. Students are empowered to own their learning; all they need is a pencil, paper and a cell phone. We are delighted to unveil this tool at NCAN together with leaders of college access organizations who work each day to propel students into opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new app is already available to download &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/daily-practice-for-the-new-sat/id1033927734?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. A step-by-step user guide to Daily Practice for the New SAT is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/practice/daily-practice-app&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, which can also be reviewed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/practice/daily-practice-app&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; on our website.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Students can get SAT Practice Scores Instantly on their Smartphone with New App &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The response was overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 20,000 students linked their accounts on that day—more than on any one day since the launch of Official SAT Practice. Every student who connected their accounts will receive SAT practice recommendations tailored to their needs that will make it easier for them to show their best work on the SAT and get ready for college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three districts with the highest percentages of 2016 PSAT/NMSQT test takers who linked their accounts on January 18 were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crown Point Community School Corporation, Indiana: 46.17%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brunswick City School District, Ohio: 40.94%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Princeton City Schools, Ohio: 35.69%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re also awarding laptops to the district with the highest percentage of 2016 PSAT/NMSQT takers who linked accounts between October 1 and January 18. Michigan’s Brighton Area School District topped that list, with 77.84% of their 2016 PSAT/NMSQT test takers connecting their accounts during that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to all the winners! We’re thrilled that so many students took advantage of the opportunity to help out their local libraries and help themselves by signing up for Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy—the only free, official, personalized SAT practice tools available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you’ll keep encouraging your students to take advantage of this one-of-a-kind SAT practice resource. Remember: They can sign up at any time at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.satpractice.org/&quot;&gt;satpractice.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*In order for a district to qualify, it must have had at least 400 students who took the October 2016 PSAT/NMSQT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;And the Winners of the SAT® Practice Challenge Are…&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

In fact, the Orange County Public Schools mission states we will &quot;lead our students to success with the support and involvement of families and the community.&quot; We want them to graduate high school, enter college or another post-secondary institution, or immediately begin a rewarding career. Ultimately, we endeavor to help our students reach their goals and take ownership of their future. Making this a reality for nearly 200,000 students is no easy task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have seen both within the district and in research that access to college-level course work while in high school contributes to better outcomes for students. That is why OCPS has put a major emphasis on Advanced Placement (college level) course work. More than 34 percent of high-school students took at least one AP course last year, which partially earned the district AP Honor Roll status in 2015 for the third time. Honor Roll status requires that you also improve the number of students passing the test at the end of the course and thereby earning college credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of special note is that, among black and Hispanic students, we have almost doubled AP enrollment numbers since 2007-2008, while at the same time increasing passing rates. Thirty-five percent more blacks passed the AP exams, and 18 percent more Hispanics scored 3 or better. The AP courses can also assist students in the college-admissions process and save them time and money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;ym_1082621030471940355&quot;&gt;Part of our process includes offering assessments that will benefit each student&#039;s quest for higher education. Today, OCPS high schools are administering the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test to all freshmen, sophomores and juniors and the Scholastic Aptitude Test to all seniors who took it last spring. The PSAT has been an anchor for the work we do throughout the district because of the valuable information it provides to educators and the tangible benefits it offers to students and their families.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PSAT is connected to the SAT and helps show how students are doing over time. That means parents, students and teachers can identify areas of strength and areas where more support is needed. Recently, the test was redesigned to better assess college readiness and better reflect what students are learning in classrooms. These changes mirror those made to the SAT, a key component of the college-admissions process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important insight that comes from PSAT scores is the student &quot;AP Potential&quot; report, indicating which Advanced Placement courses they&#039;re most likely to succeed in. This information helps us funnel a larger pool of students into AP courses, expanding the possibilities for future success. Often the PSAT results help identify students who might easily be overlooked for AP enrollment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past year and a half, the College Board — the organization that designs the PSAT, SAT and AP — announced new benefits connected to the PSAT that will help students on the path to college. New partnerships have expanded access to nearly $180 million in scholarships for PSAT-takers this school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the College Board and Khan Academy have built free, personalized practice tools available to all students. These tools help reinforce the work being done in class and prepare students to take the PSAT and the SAT. When students receive their PSAT scores this year, they&#039;ll be able to upload them to Khan Academy to receive additional SAT practice recommendations designed just for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today students are doing more than just taking a test. They are meeting an important milestone on their journey through high school and unlocking access to scholarships, advanced course work and practice tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes a multifaceted approach and a strong community within and around our schools to lead our students to success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barbara Jenkins is superintendent of Orange County Public Schools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Assessments help students find pathway to opportunities&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Autumn Loss, a senior at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ublyschools.org/&quot;&gt;Ubly Community High School&lt;/a&gt; in Ubly, Michigan, has done what seemed impossible: she increased her &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sat.org/&quot;&gt;SAT&lt;/a&gt; score by 200 points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between taking the PSAT/NMSQT and the SAT, Autumn can tell you there was no expensive test prep involved, no mystery tricks to help her get the right answers. She simply practiced two to three times a week with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.satpractice.org/&quot;&gt;Official SAT Practice&lt;/a&gt;, the free, personalized, online SAT practice tools created through a partnership between Khan Academy and the College Board.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I loved that it gave me a broad range of questions I could practice,” said Autumn. “I could see my progress.” She practiced in class and outside of school, a few times a week, on the iPad Ubly Community provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy builds a personalized study plan for each student. By linking their College Board and Khan Academy accounts, they can use their scores from the SAT, &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/psat-nmsqt-psat-10&quot;&gt;PSAT/NMSQT, PSAT 10,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/psat-8-9&quot;&gt;PSAT 8/9&lt;/a&gt; to get personalized recommendations about what to learn next. In seconds, they get a&lt;span&gt;ccess to video lessons, full-length practice tests, thousands of interactive questions, and more. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official SAT Practice helped Autumn feel confident on test day because it focused her study time on the areas where she most needed to improve—in her case, in math—and demystified the format of the questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I struggled in math, and the videos made the problems easier to understand because they walked me through how they were worded,” she said. “I really liked the videos explaining the questions, so I could figure out the question on my own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For me, Official SAT practice was not only free, but also very convenient,” Autumn added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the tools became available in June 2016, more than 3.7 million users have logged on to practice for the SAT on Khan Academy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every one of the 270 students at Ubly Community High School has at some point or another logged onto Official SAT Practice in the last year. The teachers have integrated 30 minutes of practice on Khan Academy into their math and language arts classes each week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since we cover it in class every week, I think students understand this is important,” said Janice Brandel, a school counselor at Ubly Community. “I think students and teachers see a reason to pay attention, and there&#039;s a lot of buy-in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubly Community students not only take the PSAT/NMSQT and the SAT during the school day at no cost, but the PSAT 8/9 and PSAT 10 as well, which allows younger students to identify early on where they need to improve over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Brandel says that having access to free SAT preparation through Khan Academy opens doors for her students. While some may head to a trade school after graduation, taking the SAT gives them the chance to apply to college later if they change their minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t tell them you have to get this score or that score,” she said. “We tell students, we want you to do your best. Whatever your goals are, we don’t want you to have any barriers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fall, Autumn will head to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.delta.edu/&quot;&gt;Delta College&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.michigan.gov/mistudentaid/0,4636,7-128-60969_61016-274565--,00.html&quot;&gt;TIP&lt;/a&gt; scholarship. After two years, she plans to transfer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://msu.edu/&quot;&gt;Michigan State University&lt;/a&gt; and study agricultural education and natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you know any students who would like to sign up to Official SAT Practice, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;satpractice.org&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Practice Pays Off: Autumn Loss, Ubly, Michigan&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Today, our Advisory Panel on Student Opportunity students came by to get some hands-on experience. The students had a chance to get a walk-through of the platform, learn how it can help them practice for the new SAT, and even try some practice questions. It was a great chance for us to see the platform come to life and chat with students about productive practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 8, 2017, the College Board and Khan Academy announced promising new findings, based on data from the first full year of the new SAT&lt;strong&gt;®&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was time to shatter once and for all the bad idea that the SAT was an aptitude test, that the SAT measures something that’s unclear and hard to change. The new SAT makes it easier than ever for students to show their best work,” said College Board president and CEO David Coleman. “Students who devote themselves to free, personalized SAT practice on Khan Academy are achieving substantial score gains on the new SAT and claiming their futures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Studying for the SAT on Official SAT Practice for 20 hours is associated with an average score gain of 115 points&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s nearly double the average score gain achieved by students who don&#039;t use Khan Academy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the nearly 250,000 test takers studied, &lt;strong&gt;more than 16,000 gained 200 points or more between the PSAT/NMSQT® and SAT&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the 115-point average score increase associated with 20 hours of practice, shorter practice periods also correlate with meaningful score gains. For example, &lt;strong&gt;6–8 hours of practice on Official SAT Practice is associated with an average 90-point increase&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board waited for a full year of data to analyze before releasing these results. Researchers confirmed that practice advanced students regardless of their gender, race, income, and high school GPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we’re so excited about is every young person in America getting the chance to learn a powerful lesson: that through devoted practice you can advance yourself,” said Coleman. “These tests can never tell you who you are, and they never should have. They are only an invitation to what you might become through practice. We’re trying to do everything in our power to make the SAT a launching pad from which students can change their future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/opinion/owning-your-own-future.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; op-ed columnist Thomas L. Friedman celebrated the news, dubbing Official SAT Practice a proven tool for promoting lifelong learning and “owning your own future.” He wrote: “If you want to be a lifelong employee anywhere today, you have to be a lifelong learner. And that means: More is now on you. And that means self-motivation to learn and keep learning becomes the most important life skill...Some are up for that, some not; and many want to but don’t know how, which is why the College Board has reshaped the PSAT and SAT exams to encourage lifelong learning...The good news is that systems—like Khan-College Board—are emerging everywhere to enable anyone to accelerate learning for the age of acceleration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/average-score-gains-on-redesigned-sat&quot;&gt;Read the full press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRACTICE TAKES OFF.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its launch in June 2015, more than 3.7 million students have used Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy. Nearly 40 percent of all test takers reported using Official SAT Practice, making it the number one tool for SAT preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The SAT is a strong measure of college readiness. It is heartening to see this positive association between personalized practice on Khan Academy and growth in college readiness,” said Khan Academy founder and CEO Sal Khan. “This was only possible because of the hard work of many people, especially incredible teachers, counselors and school districts who have leveraged these practice tools for their students.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GET READY FOR TEST DAY.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind every story of student success is a teacher, counselor, advisor, coach, parent, or other caring adult.&lt;/p&gt;

We’ve put together a teacher/coach implementation guide, handouts for students and parents, video resources, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joanna Garcia – Oxnard 12th&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;grader&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I had no idea what I was doing until I watched the preview video.  I really liked how they gave you examples on the problems. On the final exam, I was never really able to go into that. I thought it was my computer — it would always keep loading and loading — but I did print it out, which I thought was really cool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amairee Stokes – Columbus 10th-grader&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t know what the SAT was; I was glad I had Khan Academy because they had a whole SAT section and it tells what the SAT is about, things that are going to be on the test, and how the scoring is done. I like [how] if you get a question wrong, they have little notes, they explain why that answer is the right one. I really like how Khan Academy has all the videos and stuff if you don’t understand something. I am really grateful I got the chance to go on Khan Academy because I now know what the SAT is about. “&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our College Board team took copious notes and promised to improve the student experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You should do commercials to let people know about the free SAT practice, on YouTube and stuff like that,” said Joanna.

We want to be there for you in that moment.” So began Elizabeth Slavitt, director of content for Khan Academy (KA), as she spoke at the Forum’s closing plenary about the real-time benefits of the online learning tool and the organization’s relationship with the College Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary goals of KA, said Slavitt, is to “unblock barriers for students to achieve their goals.” So when David Coleman, president of the College Board, called her office to talk about the redesigned SAT and his desire to partner with KA to level the playing field for all students, it seemed like a perfect match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That partnership has resulted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an online tool with full-length practice SAT tests created by the College Board and practice items developed by Khan Academy in close collaboration with the makers of the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are no ordinary practice items. They are interactive questions that “learn” what each student is already good at, and where each student could use some help. The tool then produces customized practice recommendations to meet the specific needs of each student. “We build personalized learning experiences,” said Slavitt. “We let students go at their own pace, offer step-by-step [answer] explanations, and congratulate them when they achieve their goals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help always on-the-move students keep up with their practice, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/practice/daily-practice-app&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Daily Practice for the New SAT app&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is also available for free. In addition to providing the same practice questions, answer explanations, and personalized recommendations as the website, it can score a student’s paper-and-pencil practice test in a matter of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is great news, but it means nothing if students don’t know about it. “While we’ve gotten rid of the financial gap,” said Slavitt, “I suspect we still have the information gap.” And the students most in need of these tools – the low-income, lower-resourced students – are most likely to exist in circles where this is not being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please help us spread the word,” Slavitt urged. “We want every single student who could use this to know it exists — to know there are a bunch of adults who value their future enough to help them achieve their dreams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Close the Information Gap: Tell Students About Khan Academy&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;D’Andre Weaver, a quarterback on the Oak Ridge High School football team, says the work he does before a big game or a big test gives him the confidence he needs to succeed. Before taking the SAT, for example, he used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy&lt;/a&gt; to build up his math skills. “It’s like a game,” he says. “You practice, but you don’t realize you’re competing with yourself. My math skills were below par, and using Khan Academy I built it up and improved my scores dramatically.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D’Andre’s SAT score was 260 points higher than his PSAT/NMSQT score after using Official SAT Practice; he boosted his score an additional 100 points after taking the SAT a second time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wants to let other students know that—even if you’re a busy high school senior and competitive athlete—it’s possible and worth it to find time to practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explains: “The main thing you have to do is schedule a routine that you follow day in and day out. For me, there&#039;s bits and breaks where I can practice on Khan Academy, either on my phone or on the Lenovo [laptops] that are provided to us by the district. And I&#039;ve used it pretty much every day. No matter whether I&#039;m walking to the football field, going to practice, or if I’m traveling to a road game on the bus, I’m like, ‘Oh, let me pull out my phone and do some Khan Academy.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fall D’Andre will attend Lawrence University on both an athletic and academic scholarship. Watch him tell his story below, and visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://cb.collegeboard.org/sat/better-takes-practice/&quot;&gt;satpractice.org/go&lt;/a&gt; to see how other Oak Ridge students are practicing hard to achieve their own goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;GET READY FOR TEST DAY.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board and Khan Academy recently released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/academic/new-data-links-official-sat-practice-khan-academy-substantial-student&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; linking Official SAT Practice to substantial student score gains from the PSAT/NMSQT to the SAT.

Read the original &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/collegeboard/2015/11/19/current-sat-vs-new-sat-which-should-i-take/&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2015-16 school year is a unique one for the SAT because students in the class of 2017 — today’s juniors — have the option of taking two different versions of the exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current SAT will be administered on Dec. 5, 2015, and for the last time on Jan. 23, 2016.  The &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat&quot;&gt;new SAT&lt;/a&gt; — which has been redesigned to focus on the few things that matter most for college and career readiness and to better reflect what students are learning in class — will be administered for the first time on March 5, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As students decide which test to take, here is some important information to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:0.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both tests:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will be accepted by most U.S. colleges and universities for the next few years;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have been carefully researched to make sure they’re fair and valid for all students;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have free, full-length practice tests available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;KhanAcademy.org&lt;/a&gt;; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;May be taken with &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/register/fees/fee-waivers&quot;&gt;SAT fee waivers&lt;/a&gt; (by eligible students).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:0.25in&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only the new SAT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comes with free, personalized practice tools and study recommendations at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;KhanAcademy.org&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Has &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/practice/daily-practice-app&quot;&gt;an app&lt;/a&gt; that lets students take a photo of their completed practice test answer sheets with their phone and instantly receive their scores ­­— in addition to offering sample questions and answer explanations;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Has an &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/inside-the-test/essay&quot;&gt;optional essay&lt;/a&gt; (the essay on the current SAT is required); and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does not penalize students for guessing incorrectly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Students can learn more about the differences between the tests — including exam length, time per question, and the specific skills that will be tested — by visiting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/inside-the-test/compare-old-new-specifications&quot;&gt;College Board website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s juniors should feel confident taking the new SAT this spring because it better reflects what students are learning in class and its subject matter will be more familiar. More good news: Students who took the PSAT/NMSQT in October will have an excellent idea of what to expect on the new SAT because the tests share the same format and measure the same skills and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage any student who is having a hard time deciding between the two versions of the SAT to take both. Late registration is still available for the Dec. 5 test, and registration is open for both the last administration of the current exam in January and the first administration of the new exam in March. Before taking either SAT, students should check the admission policies of schools to which they’re interested in applying to make sure they have the latest application information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whichever SAT they choose, students can rest easy in the knowledge that they’re taking an important step on the road to success in college, career, and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Current SAT vs. New SAT: Which Should I Take?&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Every day, we’re humbled by their hard work and determination; today, we give a special shout-out to a few we&#039;ve met:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/academic/practice-pays-autumn-loss-ubly-michigan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Autumn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a senior at a small, rural high school, whose favorite feature on Khan Academy is the videos.

But once I found out about Khan Academy, I used it as a sledgehammer to destroy that door in front of me that was blocking me from becoming what I could’ve been, which is where I’m at now.

He noted that students will be able to create a personalized practice plan that adapts to their needs and provides support where they need it most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Preparation is one thing, but practice is everything. What we are doing with Khan Academy is getting kids to practice in a way that will prepare them for college courses,” Coleman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khan regaled the audience with the story of Khan Academy’s formation: he began shooting tutorial videos for his cousin and uploading them to YouTube. What he thought would be an educational experiment among family members grew into something larger as his videos racked up more and more viewers and comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know how many of you spend time on YouTube, but most of the comments are not thank you,” he joked with the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khan’s videos did receive plenty of positive reaction from YouTube users though, from a student attributing them for a recent A to a soldier thanking Khan for helping him prepare to return to school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A seed was planted, and Khan decided to leave his job and focus his attention on Khan Academy, whose mission would be to change education for the better by providing a free world-class education for anyone, anywhere. With support from passionate donors and advocates like Bill Gates, Khan Academy became a force in education. To-date Khan Academy has answered more than 2.5 billion problems for its more than 12 million unique monthly users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, Khan Academy and the College Board are partnering to make sure that all students have access to a quality education. The partnership will start by providing free, best-in-class SAT test preparation to all students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What you’re hearing on stage is only the beginning of this partnership with the College Board,” Khan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khan closed out the opening plenary by sharing Khan Academy’s “You Can Learn Anything” video and reiterating his passion for accessible education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Together we can make education, which has always been scarce and expensive, a fundamental human right,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
