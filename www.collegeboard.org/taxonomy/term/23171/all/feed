    <title>College Board Program Results Reveal Missed Opportunities and Areas of Promise for Students </title>

The national and state-level results paint a more complete picture of student progress during high school, showing missed opportunities for just-graduated students and areas where action can be taken to improve student outcomes for those still in high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new approach allows the College Board to focus on delivering opportunities for students by redesigning our assessments and linking them more closely to the benefits of challenging coursework and success in college. Designed to be a simple, streamlined overlay to longer data sets, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/program-results/2014/home&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the combined results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will not be released as a traditional bound report, but instead a modular collection of sections that can be consumed together or alone, giving longevity to the materials. Information will also be available on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2013, the College Board released results for the SAT class of 2013 and cited stagnant performance as a call to action to increase college and career readiness. In partnership with its members, the College Board has since engaged in an in-depth analysis of how its programs could be used to increase opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the 2013 results, on March 5, 2014, the College Board made a commitment to a redesigned SAT focused on the skills and knowledge evidence shows matter most for college and career success. The redesigned SAT will first be administered in March 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this year’s results, College Board leaders affirmed the organization’s commitment to action. “For a long time, institutions like ours have been reporting that too many students aren’t ready for college and career workforce training,” said College Board President David Coleman. “It’s time to do something about it. We at the College Board are transforming what we do to advance opportunity, including refocusing our assessments on what matters most and providing free supports for all students. Offering the same old test in the face of lasting problems is just not good enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;PSAT/NMSQT Results: Insights into Opportunities&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PSAT/NMSQT is the linchpin among the College Board programs and plays a critical role in the College Board’s work to improve student outcomes. It is the nation’s largest and most representative pre-college assessment and provides valuable early information about student progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2013-14, a record 3.7 million students took the PSAT/NMSQT. Of these, 1,678,760 (45.9 %) were minority students.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;PSAT/NMSQT results are also the best predictor of a student’s potential to succeed in certain AP courses – identifying students with a high likelihood of succeeding in particular AP subjects as early as 10th grade, and providing actionable feedback to help educators, parents, and students address any deficiencies in student preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PSAT/NMSQT results show in the public high school class of 2014, almost four out of 10 students with AP potential did not take an AP course for which they showed likelihood of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the class of 2016, nearly a half a million (491,508) students who took the PSAT/NMSQT in October 2013 show potential to succeed in AP courses. Among public school students, 381,792 show potential. For context, 38.3 % of public school students in the class of 2016 took the PSAT/NMSQT in October 2013.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;By identifying potential for more students early, we can help them take advantage of opportunities they have earned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SAT Results: Opportunities Missed in the Class of 2014&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SAT is a key piece of the college admissions process. A look at the SAT class of 2014 shows an increase in overall participation – including among minority students and students who took the exam using a fee waiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1,672,395 students from the class of 2014 took the SAT, an increase compared to 1,660,047 students last year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;793,986 students were minority students — an increase from 762,511 last year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;394,992 students took the exam using a fee waiver, an increase from 387,748 last year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, overall performance remained stagnant. Only 42.6 % of SAT takers in the class of 2014 met the SAT College and Career Readiness Benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SAT College and Career Readiness Benchmark represents those students who are likely to be ready to take college-entry, credit-bearing courses and not need remediation. This number has remained virtually unchanged over the last several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This readiness challenge remains especially acute among underrepresented minority students:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;15.8% of African American SAT takers met the benchmark.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;23.4% of Hispanic SAT takers met the benchmark.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;33.5% of Native American SAT takers met the benchmark.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers are also stagnant when compared to last year’s readiness percentages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students in the SAT class of 2014 missed opportunities that could have helped them make successful transitions to college. A look at both PSAT/NMSQT and SAT results reveals a group of students who fell off target between the time they took the PSAT/NMSQT and the SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of the 1.67 million SAT takers who graduated in 2014, just over 609,000 took the PSAT/NMSQT in the fall of their junior year and the SAT in the fall of their senior year.  Over 29,000 (5%) of these students were on target for college and career readiness in the 11th grade but fell off target by the fall of their senior year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also a group of test-takers in the SAT class of 2014 who were close to meeting the SAT Benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;9% (157,417) of the 1.67 million SAT takers who graduated in 2014 were within one year’s growth of being on target for college and career readiness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The latest SAT results reaffirm that we must address the issue of preparedness much earlier and in a more focused way,” said College Board’s Chief of Assessment, Cyndie Schmeiser. “Students in the class of 2014 missed opportunities that could have helped more of them to make successful transitions to college and career. The College Board is working toward solutions that will advance readiness and success for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;AP: Areas of Promise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AP courses offer students the opportunity to pursue college-level coursework while still in high school. Access to challenging course work in high school is a key part of ensuring successful transitions to college and careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the majority of U.S. students who enter four-year colleges do not graduate within four years, spending extra time and money to attain a bachelor’s degree. New research shows that students who have taken at least one AP exam, including those that score a 1 or 2, are more likely to graduate college on time than academically matched peers who did not take AP.  Students who score a 3, 4, or 5 on AP Exams have the potential to save time and money through credit-granting policies at more than 3,900 colleges and universities in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A look at the May 2014 AP Exam administration shows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1,478,084 11th and 12th grade public school students took AP in 2014, an increase of 3.8% from last year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;408,808 were traditionally underrepresented minority students, an increase of 7.0% from last year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;355,379 were low-income students, an increase of 7.3% from last year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, 21.9 % of public high school 11th- and 12th-graders took an AP Exam last year. However, gaps continue to persist – some small and some large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;19.1 % of Hispanic students, 12.9 % of African American students, and 12.0% of Native American students took an AP Exam last year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access to AP is particularly important for underserved students because of the ways AP classes connect students to college majors and careers. For example, research finds that African-American and Hispanic students who take AP STEM coursework are 2 - 4 times more likely than their peers to major in related STEM disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, educators have achieved a steady increase in the percentage of students who earn high AP Exam scores of 3, 4, or 5 before leaving high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The percentage of the nation’s public high school 11th- and 12th graders succeeding on at least one AP Exam has nearly doubled over the past decade from 7.6% in May 2004 to 13.2% in May 2014.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The College Board remains committed to ensuring all students with the potential to succeed in AP courses are able to access those opportunities,” said Trevor Packer, senior vice president of AP and instruction. “Research clearly shows that challenging coursework in high school is a vital component in helping students succeed as they transition to college and beyond.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The College Board Readiness and Success System&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board believes in demanding more from assessments so that they inspire productive practice and support students who are behind.  Prior to the administration of &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; title=&quot;Delivering Opportunity website&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the redesigned SAT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in spring 2016, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/psat-nmsqt-psat-10&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;[Opens in New Window] Learn more about the redesigned PSAT/NMSQT&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;redesigned PSAT/NMSQT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will launch in October 2015 alongside a redesign of the College Board’s eighth/ninth-grade assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focused on the few skills that evidence shows matter most for college and career success, all of these assessments – components of the College Board Readiness and Success System – will provide more actionable results for students and educators beginning in middle school. These results will include monitoring student progress toward college and career readiness, identifying skills that need strengthening, and connecting student performance to practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last March, the College Board committed to confronting inequities driven by high-cost test preparation by partnering with Khan Academy to develop free, world-class practice to help students of all backgrounds prepare for the redesigned SAT. In addition, the College Board is developing high quality, free resources, including career planning tools, to support students in the earlier years of critical preparation in middle school and high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board’s commitment to action also extends to helping students overcome financial barriers that prevent them from successfully transitioning to college and career. Currently the College Board contributes approximately $78 million in program fee waivers to students each year. And with the support of colleges and universities, the College Board recently launched the &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/guidance/access-to-opportunity/college-application-fee-waivers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;[Opens in New Window] College Application Fee Waiver Program&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;College Application Fee Waiver Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  to directly provide four college application fee waivers to every income-eligible senior who takes the SAT or SAT Subject Test using a fee waiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through its SAT School Day program, the College Board is also working with state and district partners to give students the option to take the SAT during the school day at the district or state’s expense. The program is especially beneficial for those students who otherwise might not be able to travel to a test center on a national weekend test date. Research examining state supported SAT administrations has shown that increasing student access to the SAT has resulted in higher college-going rates, particularly among students who would not have considered college otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working closely with members and partner organizations, we’ve also launched a series of initiatives to ensure that students who have demonstrated the potential to succeed in AP courses are able to access them.  These efforts include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/k-12/all-in&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;[Opens in New Window] Learn more about the All In campaign&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All In&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; campaign, developed to ensure that 100 % of African American, Latino, and Native American students with AP potential enroll in at least one AP class in a subject for which they’ve shown potential;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/initiatives/ap-stem-access-program&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;[Opens in New Window] AP Central website&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AP STEM Access program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative created in partnership with Google and DonorsChoose.org that is providing 10,000 additional minority and female students with access to participate in AP STEM courses; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/initiatives/ap-opportunity-program&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; title=&quot;Learn more about the AP Opportunity program&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AP Opportunity program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which will enable 70 schools across the nation to start nearly 140 new AP courses and expand access to academically prepared low-income students&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on these results, College Board President and CEO David Coleman said, “The College Board won’t stand still with the same test and the same program while student readiness results are far too low and unchanging.  The College Board will redouble its work to challenge students to focus their efforts, practice hard, and remove the barriers in their way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;College Board Program Results Reveal Missed Opportunities and Areas of Promise for Students &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The PSAT/NMSQT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, SAT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, and AP&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Exams always have been opportunity assessments, linking students to scholarships, college admission, and course credit. Anchored in the belief that students today need more opportunities — not more tests — the College Board has redesigned these exams and connected them to a wider array of educational and scholarship benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students taking the PSAT/NMSQT will have increased access to money for college through the College Board’s partnership with five of the country’s leading scholarship providers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students taking the redesigned SAT can benefit from free, personalized, interactive practice tools on KhanAcademy.org.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The AP Program has partnered with college professors and AP teachers nationwide to create new AP courses in critical STEM fields, while partnering with states to enact uniform credit policies that will help ensure that students receive the college credits they have earned through AP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PSAT/NMSQT, SAT, and AP results provide valuable information that can help ensure that more students graduate from high school ready for college and career. To support&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;decision-makers in using these results to effect change for students, the College Board has outlined three strategies to improve access and performance, bolster college graduation rates, and further increase participation in STEM course work. These strategies are part of the College Board’s ongoing commitment to connect assessments with opportunities that help more students make successful transitions to college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need fewer tests that do more,” said College Board President David Coleman. “We’re seeing great momentum through the wide and growing range of opportunities that our assessments provide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are highlights from the &lt;em&gt;2015 Program Results&lt;/em&gt; and the recommended strategies to support educators and students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Access and Participation &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding access to actionable assessments and challenging course work is an important way to connect students to college and career opportunities. Significant gains were made in access to the three College Board programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PSAT/NMSQT: Record number of test-takers. &lt;/strong&gt;In the fall of 2014, a record 3.8 million students took the PSAT/NMSQT, up from 3.7 million in 2013 and 3.6 million in 2010.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAT: Growing participation.&lt;/strong&gt; A record 1.7 million students from the class of 2015 took the SAT, compared to 1.67 million students from the graduating class of 2014 and 1.65 million in the class of 2011. A total of 25.1 percent of SAT takers in the class of 2015 took the exam using a fee waiver, compared to 23.6 percent in the class of 2014 and 21.3 percent in the class of 2011.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AP: Record number of students takes AP Exams. &lt;/strong&gt;2.5 million students took an AP Exam in 2015, compared to 2.3 million in 2014 and just under 2 million in 2011.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Performance and Success&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased access to assessments can help educators monitor student progress, understand skill areas in need of improvement, and identify students’ potential to succee in challenging course work. Results from the PSAT/NMSQT are the best predictor of a student’s potential to succeed in certain AP courses. &lt;strong&gt;In 2014-15, about 520,000 10th-grade PSAT/NMSQT takers overall showed potential to succeed in at least one AP course.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AP courses offer students the opportunity to pursue college-level course work while still in high school. Students who succeed on AP Exams are more likely than other students to graduate from college on time, and they have the potential to save time and money through placement and credit-granting policies. &lt;strong&gt;More than 1.5 million students received a score of 3 or higher on an AP Exam in 2015, compared to 1.4 million in 2014 and 1.2 million in 2011.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assessment results also can inform whether students are on track for college and career readiness.&lt;strong&gt; Nearly 766,000 (48 percent) of 11th-grade PSAT/NMSQT takers met the grade-level benchmark, indicating they are on track for college and career readiness. &lt;/strong&gt;In addition, these results can help educators and policymakers see areas of progress and growth, as well as areas for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SAT is a proven and trusted indicator of college readiness and success for students from all backgrounds. &lt;strong&gt;More than 712,000 students (41.9 percent of SAT takers in the class of 2015) met the SAT College and Career Readiness Benchmark. &lt;/strong&gt;High school graduates who reach the benchmark are more likely to enroll in a four-year college and graduate on time than those who do not meet the benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Solutions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the results, the College Board has highlighted three ways in which education leaders and policymakers can help propel students toward college and career opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage more students to think about higher education and participate in the college-going process&lt;/strong&gt;. With the support of states and districts, &lt;strong&gt;SAT School Day&lt;/strong&gt; allows juniors and seniors to take the SAT in their schools on a regular school day and avoids common complications of Saturday testing — such as part-time jobs, family responsibilities, and finding transportation. To date, all states that have made this commitment to access have seen growth in the number of students meeting the benchmark and gaining access to college.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Said Chief of Assessment Cyndie Schmeiser: “We are excited that more students are participating in SAT School Day because of all the benefits that come with it. By removing common barriers for students — like transportation or weekend work commitments — we are able to foster a college-going culture and increase access to college, especially among first-generation college-bound students. Through our assessments, we’re connecting students to opportunity with college application fee waivers and free personalized practice with Khan Academy, thereby encouraging more students to pursue a college education.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help students make the most of their college experience and graduate in four years&lt;/strong&gt;. The AP Program enlists and encourages talented teachers, provides exciting,in-depth classroom experiences, and gives students the opportunity to master challenging subject matter that often is related to their choice of a college major. &lt;strong&gt;A statewide AP college credit policy &lt;/strong&gt;helps ensure that public universities and colleges consistently and fairly recognize AP students’ academic achievements and simultaneously provides these institutions with an innovative solution to improve retention and decrease time to degree. As of August 2015, 17 states — most recently Illinois, Texas, and Virginia — have implemented unified and consistent statewide or systemwide AP policies to ensure that students’ achievements are equitably recognized.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure that more students are inspired and prepared to become the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) professionals our nation needs. &lt;/strong&gt;According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the need for jobs in science, technology, engineering, and math is expected to increase by 13 percent between 2012 and 2022 (versus 11 percent growth for all occupations). As a nation, we are not graduating nearly enough STEM majors to meet this need. Research shows that students who take AP math and science courses are more likely than non-AP students to earn degrees in physical science, engineering, and life science disciplines. To address this need, &lt;strong&gt;the AP Program has expanded its STEM offerings&lt;/strong&gt;. In 2014-15, their inaugural year, AP Physics 1 and 2 showed the largest growth of any courses in the history of AP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Senior Vice President of AP and Instruction Trevor Packer said: “We believe that inspiring and preparing students for in-demand STEM careers is an important opportunity for AP math and science courses. The launch of the AP Physics 1 and 2 courses this year attracted nearly double the number of high school students to enroll in algebra-based AP Physics classes, and demand for AP Computer Science A and our forthcoming AP Computer Science Principles is high. These results show that America’s students are eager to take on the challenge of STEM.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;A Look Forward&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the College Board announced it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;redesign&lt;/a&gt; the SAT and PSAT/NMSQT and introduce the PSAT&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; 10 and PSAT 8/9&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; to focus on the skills that recent data show matter most for success in college and career. A parallel focus on depth over breadth has been informing the redesign of AP course frameworks and exams so that teachers and students gain more time to develop the knowledge and skills required in college course work. The redesigned courses and assessments will launch on a rolling basis. Redesigned courses and exams in &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/arts-and-world-languages/art-history&quot;&gt;AP Art History&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/english-history-and-social-science/european-history&quot;&gt;AP European History&lt;/a&gt;, along with a new course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/ap-capstone/ap-research&quot;&gt;AP Capstone&lt;sup&gt;™ &lt;/sup&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt;, are in place for the 2015-16 school year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first administrations of the PSAT/NMSQT and PSAT 8/9 will take place in October 2015, and the first administrations of the PSAT 10 and SAT will be given in March 2016. Working with College Board members and partners, the redesigned assessments will connect students to more opportunities than ever before, including fee waivers for assessments and college applications, increased access to more scholarships, and free, personalized practice tools on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;KhanAcademy.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;2015 College Board Program Results Show More Students Taking Challenging Courses, Need to Improve Readiness Remains&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Read the full report &lt;a href=&quot;https://reports.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The full press release is included below but you can get a copy of the press release &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/releases/2016/college-board-announces-surge-students-taking-new-sat-suite-opportunity-pathway-six-million-students&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 6.7 million test-takers completed the SAT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; or a PSAT-related assessment during the 2015-16 school year, according to the 2016 SAT Suite of Assessments results released today. The SAT Suite of Assessments, which launched in 2015, includes the new SAT, PSAT/NMSQT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, PSAT 10&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt;, and PSAT 8/9&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt;, and helps millions of students and educators set an earlier trajectory for college and career readiness. This is because it focuses on areas that research and evidence show matter most and reflects what students are already learning in class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More test-takers completed the new SAT from March through June of this year than took the old SAT during the same period in 2015, which is a substantial show of support for the test’s redesign. Nearly 1.36 million test-takers took the new SAT in 2016, compared to 1.18 million who took the old SAT in 2015. This is a jump of approximately 180,000 SAT takers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have transformed all of our tests to deliver greater opportunities and to clear a path for students to succeed in college and careers,” said College Board President and CEO David Coleman. “No other assessments provide students access to hundreds of millions of dollars in scholarships and free, personalized practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unprecedented numbers of students now have more and better access to opportunity because an increasing number of states, schools, and districts offer the SAT or a PSAT-related assessment to their students. The number of students who took the SAT during a school day more than doubled: there were over 458,000 SAT School Day participants in 2015-16, compared to nearly 219,500 in 2014-15. Twelve states, the District of Columbia, and 561 districts administered the new SAT or a PSAT-related assessment to their students during a school day in 2015-16, compared to eight states, the District of Columbia, and 429 districts that administered the old SAT or a PSAT-related assessment in 2014-15. It is anticipated that in 2016-17, the SAT or a PSAT-assessment will be administered during a school day in 13 states, the District of Columbia, and more than 700 districts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing great momentum working with states and districts to create a pipeline for students to become college ready,” said Cyndie Schmeiser, chief of assessment for the College Board. “We are providing educators with information that better equips them to identify students who are falling behind and allows them to intervene and differentiate instructional work much earlier in high school and middle school.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Connecting Students to Opportunities&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing more information about students’ college readiness, College Board assessments connect students to opportunities such as test and college application fee waivers, challenging course work, scholarships, and free, personalized practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the College Board’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; launched in June 2015, more than 1.7 million unique users have signed up to practice for the SAT — free of charge. In nearly half of all U.S. high schools, students are logging on to the site for productive practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now, preparing for college is the same as practicing for the SAT,” said Schmeiser. “For the first time, there is equal access to world-class SAT preparation. And it’s free. Our data show more students across all ethnicities and income brackets prepare for the SAT with Khan Academy than with all commercial test-prep courses combined.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to our surveys of SAT takers, nearly 60% who took the new SAT this spring and practiced for the test reported using Official SAT Practice to prepare, compared to 19% who used commercial test prep, and there was a&lt;strong&gt; 10% drop in the number of students who paid for SAT prep resources.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, students taking the first administration of the redesigned PSAT/NMSQT and the new PSAT 10 had access to nearly $180 million in combined annual awards through our new scholarship partners. These &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/psat-nmsqt-psat-10/scholarships-and-recognition/new-scholarships&quot;&gt;new partnerships&lt;/a&gt;, combined with the College Board’s longstanding partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalmerit.org/&quot;&gt;National Merit Scholarship Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, create a portfolio of scholarship opportunities that reach every major segment of students. For example, as a result of taking the PSAT/NMSQT or PSAT 10, more applicants than ever before were identified as potential recipients of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jkcf.org/&quot;&gt;Jack Kent Cooke Foundation&lt;/a&gt; scholarships. In 2016, 32% of the Cooke Scholars were identified because they took the PSAT/NMSQT or PSAT 10, and each received a full $40,000 a year in scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2007, income-eligible students have received eight free score reports. &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3102/0162373716665198&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that these students are more likely (by 10 percentage points) to send eight or more score reports to colleges than was the case before this free score report initiative was implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Other participation and performance highlights from this year’s report: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Old SAT Results: Class of 2016 &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the SAT redesign, this year’s performance data from the graduating class of 2016 includes students who took the old SAT through its last administration in January 2016. Comparisons of SAT results for the class of 2016 to those of previous graduating classes cannot be made because the number of test administrations and the characteristics of the class cohort are different from those in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To provide a more accurate comparison, below are the mean scores for students in the graduating class of 2016 who took the SAT at least once through January 2016, and mean scores for students in the graduating class of 2015 who took the SAT at least once through January 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The old SAT critical reading mean score was 494 for the class of 2016, compared to 497 for the class of 2015.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The old SAT math mean score was 508 for the class of 2016, compared to 512 for the class of 2015.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The old SAT writing mean score was 482 for the class of 2016, compared to 487 for the class of 2015.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all three areas, the mean scores for those 2016 high school graduates who took the old SAT through January 2016 are slightly below the average scores for the 2015 high school graduates who took the old SAT through January 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;PSAT-Related Assessment Results &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PSAT/NMSQT was redesigned alongside the SAT and administered for the first time in fall 2015. Over 4 million students took the redesigned PSAT/NMSQT in fall 2015, more than the previous high volume of 3.8 million in the fall in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data below report the percentage of students who met or exceeded the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/about/scores/benchmarks&quot;&gt;College and Career Readiness Benchmarks&lt;/a&gt; for their particular grade and assessment taken. There are two section-level benchmarks for the SAT and the grade-level benchmarks: one for the Math section and one for the Evidence-Based Reading and Writing section. Overall college readiness is defined as achieving both of the section-level benchmarks. The below figures represent the percentage of test takers by grade and assessment taken who met or exceeded both section-level benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the groups of students are those who chose to take each assessment and are not nationally representative, the percentages of college-ready students across the assessments cannot be compared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2015, 38.5% of 10th-grade students who took the PSAT/NMSQT in the fall met the new 10th-grade College and Career Readiness Benchmark.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2015, 41.6% of 11th-grade students who took the PSAT/NMSQT met the new 11th-grade College and Career Readiness Benchmark.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In spring 2016, 38.2% of 10th-graders who took the PSAT 10 in the spring met the new 10th-grade College and Career Readiness Benchmark.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2015-16, 32.1% of eighth-graders who took the PSAT 8/9 met the new eighth-grade College and Career Readiness Benchmark. For ninth-graders who took the PSAT 8/9, 37.6% met the new ninth-grade College and Career Readiness Benchmark.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The percentages we’re seeing from the PSAT-related assessments indicate that there are still far too many students who are not on target to become college ready by the time they graduate from high school,” said Schmeiser. “We still have much work to do to help these students prepare for success after high school.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AP Potential™:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was a 7% increase in the number of 11th-grade PSAT/NMSQT takers who showed high potential to succeed in at least one AP course based on their test results, from 750,524 in 2014 to 802,642 in 2015.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was an 8% increase in the number of 10th-grade PSAT/NMSQT takers who showed high potential to succeed in at least one AP course based on their test results, from 519,668 in 2014 to 561,469 in 2015.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;New SAT:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board redesigned the SAT to make it more straightforward and connected to classroom learning. It remains a strong indicator of college readiness for all students. Some of the changes reflected in the new SAT include removing the guessing penalty, focusing on words students will use in college and careers, and making the essay optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the debut of the new SAT, the College Board surveyed approximately 70,000 test-takers and found that students not only prefer the new test to the old but support changes to the test to make it more focused and clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;By a 7-to-1 margin, students said they preferred the format of the new SAT over&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:1.0in&quot;&gt;that of the old SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;80% of students reported feeling confident going into the new SAT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;77% said the vocabulary on the new test would be useful to them later in life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;75% said the Reading Test was the same as or easier than they expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;72% said the new test reflected what they’re learning in school.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s new SAT data cannot be compared to that of previous years because the redesigned SAT is a different assessment from the old SAT. Moreover, the scale that has been established for the SAT Suite of Assessments is a new scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new SAT gives schools and districts around the country new tools and resources to help students succeed. For California’s Long Beach Unified School District (LBUSD), offering the SAT for free during a school day is a key step in preparing students for college — as is administering the PSAT 8/9, PSAT10, and the PSAT/NMSQT. With the SAT Suite of Assessments, LBUSD connects its students to scholarship opportunities, identifies students with AP potential, and provides valuable information to support its students as they prepare for college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the year, the district has encouraged its students to link their College Board and Khan Academy accounts to receive a personalized SAT study plan based on the PSAT-related assessment results. As of this writing, 73% of LBUSD students have done so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The College Board and Khan Academy’s customized online tutorials help level the playing field for students,” said Christopher J. Steinhauser, LBUSD superintendent. “We provide these resources at no cost to students and parents, who appreciate the great value we’re adding to the college-prep effort. By accurately assessing students’ strengths and areas for improvement, and then providing effective and targeted support based on that assessment, we’re reaching more students and seeing more of them prepare for success in college.”&lt;/p&gt;
