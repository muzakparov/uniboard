We honor the key role you play in the lives of aspiring students. We’re excited to share College Board: All Access, our newest communications tool to help better connect K-12 and Higher Ed members to the College Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our New England Regional members are among the finest seasoned and emerging leaders in secondary and post-secondary education. Together, we want to help one another learn and grow in the profession and help propel the students we serve into opportunities that they have earned. We want to extend our ongoing invitation to partner with you in your important work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fall, we have already coordinated several convenings for our members including the very successful &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/higher-ed/financial-aid/institute-financial-aid&quot;&gt;2014 Financial Aid Institute&lt;/a&gt;. The New England Team was able to reach nearly 1,400 school counselors at &lt;a href=&quot;https://counselorworkshops.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;workshops&lt;/a&gt; held throughout New England since the start of the school year. We are also hosting webinars and other informational sessions on the redesigned SAT. More information on the new SAT can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;collegereadiness.collegeboard.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the College Board released program results for the class of 2014, which shows that New England’s students are high performers on the PSAT/NMSQT, Advanced Placement, and SAT. Participation rates and SAT scores were among the highest in the nation in several New England states.  And, four out of the six New England states were above the national average in Advanced Placement in both participation and performance, a real testament to providing students access and the support they need to succeed. Your New England based-team is working with educators throughout our region by providing effective tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/start-grow-ap/grow-ap/ap-potential&quot;&gt;AP Potential&lt;/a&gt; so that students who exhibit potential for more challenging course work are identified and provided the opportunities AP courses offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the College Board, thank you for all that you do to support students so that they have the opportunity to pursue a post-secondary education. Together, we can deliver opportunity to countless students throughout our region, the country, and the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to bringing you up to date information from the New England region on All Access, and I encourage all members in the region to share their own news with College Board membership by clicking &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/all-access/submit-article&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;News from New England’s Regional Vice President and Regional Council Chair&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The states, which currently use the Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBAC) exam to comply with federal high school testing guidelines, Thursday received a waiver from the U.S. Department of Education to implement the changes for the upcoming school year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The College Board will work with both states to ensure that students, parents, and educators can benefit from the opportunities connected to our assessments, including opportunities for fee waivers, scholarships, and free, personalized practice tools on KhanAcademy.org.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Two Northeast States Announce Statewide Administration of SAT Next Spring&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

As participants in the NYC Department of Education’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://schools.nyc.gov/Offices/mediarelations/NewsandSpeeches/2015-2016/Arts+Matters.htm&quot;&gt;Arts Matter&lt;/a&gt; initiative, these public school principals, teachers, and coordinators build robust arts programs in historically under-served schools throughout the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman opened his remarks with the words of legendary dancer and choreographer Martha Graham. “I believe that we learn by practice,” Coleman said, invoking Graham’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://thisibelieve.org/essay/16583/&quot;&gt;This I Believe&lt;/a&gt;” essay, and described how artists endure difficult, focused, sometimes even painful practice to make great work. They get frustrated, they fail. They iterate often. They revise over and over again. And yet through these efforts, they find beauty, grace, and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But what does this activity of the soul have to do with the College Board?” Coleman asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board’s commitment to arts reverberates through its Advanced Placement arts programs. In 2015, more than 80,000 students took AP art exams, in subjects ranging from art history to studio art to music theory. And it was the community of educators around these students, said Coleman, that enabled them to excel — giving them space to express themselves, to make and revise work, to practice, to assemble strong portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is only one force that has changed student performance at scale in this country, and that is a great teacher,” Coleman declared. “The only technology we know that can really help our students grow is teachers like you.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, he admitted, the College Board has to do more. It is simply not enough to offer AP arts courses — we must also provide equal access to the tools that make high-quality arts instruction and learning possible. “We must make the tools of practice free,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, Coleman was pleased to share information about the College Board’s collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://smarthistory.org/&quot;&gt;Smarthistory&lt;/a&gt;, an online multimedia resource for the study of art and cultural heritage. As of this year, Smarthistory has more than 200 vetted contributors (art historians, archeologists, curators, and academics) and features more than 1,500 essays and videos. This content is freely available to a global audience, and it delves into nearly all of the works covered in the AP Art History course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the College Board celebrated the arts during the second annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/academic/winners-second-atlantic-and-college-board-writing-prize-contest&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; College Board Writing Prize&lt;/a&gt;. This year’s contest asked high school students to submit essays that insightfully analyzed and interpreted a work of art that made an impression on them. Over 2,000 students from 43 countries submitted essays on more than 700 paintings, sculptures, and drawings. The award-winning essays, Coleman said, highlighted both the power and the importance of students being able to express their understanding of artistic works through writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For students to be recognized for their work in the arts,” he said, “they must be able to write about them.” By coupling arts instruction and writing instruction, arts teachers best position their students to thoughtfully engage with — and show their aptitude in — the arts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To close his keynote, Coleman made one point clear: “There’s no doubt arts education is important and beneficial for college and career readiness. The College Board speaks to schools all across the country to make sure the arts have their rightful place. But I think we as educators have to pause. We need to confess and declare that education is not just about preparing for college and careers. It is a soul craft.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the arts teachers present, he continued: “The work you do every day with your students surpasses the values of this earth — it moves into deep questions about how fully students live their lives and how fully they can express their deepest experiences. At the College Board we believe those values are essential, they are worth investing in, and they are deeply valuable to students’ futures — inside and outside the classroom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;The Arts Matter&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newark, NJ&lt;/em&gt; – Newark Public Schools (NPS) today announced an expansive partnership with the College Board to further the district’s goal of increasing the number of students who graduate from high school and pursue a college education. Through this partnership, NPS will work with the College Board to provide expanded access to the Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT®) and the SAT®, as well as a higher quality and quantity of Advanced Placement® (AP®) course work, an important consideration in college applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our partnership with the College Board is critically important to the future long-term academic success of our young men and women. It is time that we offer students in Newark the same opportunities that students across New Jersey have been afforded for a number of years,” said NPS Superintendent Christopher D. Cerf. “The College Board is partnering with us to ensure that students recognize and make the most of the opportunities available to them and realize their tremendous potential.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;District leadership worked with school leaders and educators across the district to gather feedback on the decision and to identify the programs, resources, and assessments that would provide students with the most value. Our partnership with the College Board is designed to increase access to valuable assessments and courses that play a key role in the college admission and success process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT)&lt;/strong&gt;: Beginning this fall, NPS will provide the PSAT/NMSQT to all of the district’s 10th- and 11th-grade students. The PSAT/NMSQT measures the same skills and knowledge as the SAT, so students and educators will be able to monitor progress and identify areas in need of improvement. In addition, PSAT/NMSQT results are the best predictor of a student&#039;s likelihood to succeed in certain AP courses. And, students who take the PSAT/NMSQT can access more than $180 million in expanded scholarship opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAT School Day&lt;/strong&gt;: NPS will participate in SAT School Day in April, providing the test to all 11th-graders at individual schools across the district. SAT School Day helps foster a college-going culture and increases access to college, especially among first-generation college-bound students. SAT School Day is especially beneficial for those students who may otherwise face barriers to standard Saturday administrations and would miss out on this important step in the college-going process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Official SAT Practice Through Khan Academy&lt;/strong&gt;®: All students have access to free, personalized practice through Khan Academy, a leader in online education. Official SAT Practice on khanacademy.org is helping to level the playing field for all students who are interested in taking the SAT and preparing for college. Students who take the PSAT/NMSQT and SAT benefit from these tools, which help reinforce what students are learning in classrooms and focus on the content tested, not just test-taking strategies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The PSAT/NMSQT and SAT are assessments that provide opportunities for students to qualify for financial scholarships, as well as improve their college readiness,” said Superintendent Cerf. “We will stop administering unnecessary tests, and instead focus on providing assessments that offer valuable information to help advance our students’ educational opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NPS and the College Board will also work together to increase the quality and quantity of the Advanced Placement courses offered across the district. The district will begin by offering NPS teachers access to AP Mentoring, a teacher-to-teacher professional development program, to ensure educators are successful in leading AP course work. Research shows that students who succeed in challenging course work, such as Advanced Placement, are more likely to graduate college on time, and have the potential to save time and money through placement and credit-granting policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to partner with Newark Public Schools and the entire community of Newark,” said College Board President and CEO David Coleman. “Assessment without opportunity is a thing of the past. We are committed to partnering with the Newark Public Schools to ensure that every student has access to tests that can deliver powerful benefits, including scholarships, college admission, and course credit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board will expand its acclaimed Access to Opportunity™ program to more Newark students. The College Board will provide high school course work information, college application fee waivers, and critical financial aid guidance to Newark students. Additionally, the College Board will work with community-based organizations, such as the Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club, to train them on the use of Khan Academy practice tools so students can continue their academic preparation after the normal school day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Newark Public Schools Partners with the College Board to Expand Student Access to SAT Testing and AP Course Work&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

He couldn’t imagine taking the same route to work each day, to the same office, and doing the same few things. Once he mastered the job, how would he stay interested?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after twelve years at The Ohio State University, Dr. Strayhorn is asking a different question: “How will I get it all done in just 30 years?” As the world changes, he noticed, our students change, and the work we need to do to serve them changes. “After more than a decade in the classroom,” he said, “I’m not sure I know anything at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this year’s New England Regional Forum in Boston, Dr. Strayhorn proved he has plenty of wisdom to share with educators. Here are some highlights from his opening keynote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.Diversity matters in higher ed—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and beyond.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collaborating with peers with different perspectives, from different backgrounds, can help college students get a job, Dr. Strayhorn said. Research shows that employers are looking for people who are ready to work on teams with people different from themselves. “If you leave school without this skill, you’re less competitive,” he said. “If you make fun of or avoid people who are different than you, if you snicker or change seats, you’re denying yourself the opportunity to get the skills you need for your future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students keep us grounded.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Dr. Strayhorn has done extensive formal research, his day-to-day interactions with students bring his findings to life. During his keynote he mentioned how conversations with incoming students, current students, and graduates have sharpened his perspective, led to new research questions, or challenged his assumptions. He warned: “Our prejudices determine what we think the needs, supports, or kinds of majors might be appropriate for a student”—we need to get to know each of them well before we assume what they need. This may not be easy, he admitted, but “it’s our job to sit in uncomfortable seats so our students can be more comfortable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Don’t ever get so smart you can’t talk to your mom.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Education can change you—the way you look at the world, the way you talk. When Dr. Strayhorn was scolded by his grandmother for using obscure, technical vocabulary in conversation, he realized how important it was for students to not lose touch with their roots. We want our students to grow and reach their full potential, Dr. Strayhorn advised, but we need to “make sure their experience never rips them away from their communities of origin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be the keynote.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While traveling across the country to give keynote speeches is rewarding, Dr. Strayhorn encouraged audience members to “&lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; the keynote”—to inspire others through their everyday work. You don’t need a podium to change the world, he reminded us. “We impact society through the work we do with each and every day with students.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Four Reminders from Dr. Strayhorn&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Governor Karyn Polito, Dr. Jeff Leiden, and U.S. Representative Joseph Kennedy III, has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mass.gov/edu/gov-funds-costs-of-ap-exams-for-stem-related-subjects.html&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the state will pay for low-income students taking Advanced Placement (AP) Exams in biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, calculus, environmental science, and statistics in May 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one-time allocation of approximately $326,000 is expected cover the costs for low-income students taking the tests across the state. Previously, since 1998, a federal program called the AP Test Fee Program had provided states with dedicated funding to offset the costs of AP Exams for low-income students. Beginning in 2017, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) eliminates this program and consolidates AP funding with 40 other educational programs under a new Title IV, Part A block grant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Massachusetts has one of the fastest growing innovation economies in the nation, and it is important we continue to develop a strong pipeline of skilled workers to fill critical job openings in STEM fields,” Governor Charlie Baker said in a news release. “The Administration’s ability to help provide this impromptu support will ensure low-income students who are challenging themselves with AP courses are given the opportunity to earn college credit for their hard work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With the AP exams approaching soon, I am pleased to announce that we are able to cover the cost of these exams for STEM subjects to support advanced placement testing and bolster more opportunities for student success,” added Lt. Governor Karyn Polito, who co-chairs the STEM Advisory Council. “We know this was a great concern for many educators, students and their families, and we are very happy that the Administration and the STEM Advisory Council can help.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the STEM Advisory Council expect this one-time support will provide a bridge for districts to cover costs during the 2017-18 school year; later, school officials will be in a better position to predict federal aid levels and appropriately plan for continuing AP STEM access for all Massachusetts students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board recognizes Massachusetts officials for their leadership and has been working with states and districts across the country to ensure continued access to AP Exam funding.

At the high school level, the state will use the PSAT and SAT to meet federal testing requirements. Currently all Rhode Island 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; graders take the PSAT and all 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; graders take the SAT at no cost during a school day. The state is in discussions with Massachusetts to use “RICAS,” a Rhode Island administration of the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS), for grades 3-8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Taken together, this combination of RICAS and PSAT/SAT provides us with the best, most consistent measure of student progress, without placing undue burden on students and educators,” Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education Ken Wagner said in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ride.ri.gov/InsideRIDE/AdditionalInformation/News/ViewArticle/tabid/408/ArticleId/387/Rhode-Island-to-Adopt-New-State-Assessment-Service-Providers.aspx&quot;&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;. “This approach will provide continuity in the classroom for teachers and students, maintain high quality assessment information about student progress, build a long-term partnership with a high performing neighboring state, and further decrease testing time. The short-term impact will be small, but the long-term benefits have the potential to be significant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Rhode Island to Adopt New State Assessments&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
