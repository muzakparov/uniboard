&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the full letter: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November 19, 2014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Colleague:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a country, we are leaving far too much talent on the table. Too many high achieving African American, Latino, and Native American students — students who have demonstrated the potential to do well in Advanced Placement® (AP®) courses — are not enrolling in those courses. This is an enormous missed opportunity for them and for all of us working for a stronger, fairer, and more secure nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ground that’s been gained for these students has largely been the result of the inspired and dogged work of superintendents, school board members, staff, and teachers in our major cities. The new partnership between the Council of the Great City Schools, the College Board, and the White House — through its My Brother’s Keeper initiative — aims to bolster the good work already under way, share lessons learned as broadly as possible, and dramatically increase the proportion of students of color with AP potential who are enrolled in AP courses. We are pleased to announce that the National Council of La Raza, the National Urban League, and The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights will also be joining us in this effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real success of this effort depends on you, your schools, counselors, and teachers. Success — we have learned from leading districts — is a dynamic mixture of good data and human interaction. Without the data, we can’t effectively target outreach and resources. The College Board’s AP Potential™ tool provides critical information about which students have demonstrated — by their performance on the PSAT/NMSQT® — potential to succeed in AP. PSAT/NMSQT scores often uncover academic ability that might otherwise be overlooked, and they spotlight those students ready to be successful in AP. And in focus group after focus group, these students tell us that the single most important factor in their decision to take an AP class was the support and encouragement from adults in their school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are in the strongest position to make a difference — by establishing a clear districtwide priority, by setting public goals for improvement, by monitoring progress at individual schools, and by providing guidance and support to your principals as they encourage students with AP potential to take these courses. We at the College Board and the Council of the Great City Schools have found our collaboration to be invaluable, and we believe that you will too. We have asked the College Board’s regional vice presidents to set up meetings in December with each of you. The purpose of these meetings is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review the PSAT/NMSQT data for your districts and schools;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set goals for improving AP enrollment of African American, Native American, and Latino students this spring;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify needs that your district will have in meeting these goals; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assess how the College Board and the Council can help you meet these goals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For reference, we are including a possible agenda for these meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next couple of weeks, a member of the College Board staff will be in touch with you about setting up an initial meeting. In the interim, we invite you to view this webinar about the steps you can take to propel our students forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you will consider sharing it with the principals and counselors in your district as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or need any additional information, please feel free to reach out to Amy Wilkins (&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:awilkins@collegeboard.org&quot;&gt;awilkins@collegeboard.org&lt;/a&gt;) or Ray Hart (&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:rhart@cgcs.org&quot;&gt;rhart@cgcs.org&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Casserly&lt;/strong&gt;, Executive Director of the Council of the Great City Schools and &lt;strong&gt;David Coleman&lt;/strong&gt;, President and CEO of the College Board&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Letter to CGCS Superintendents from David Coleman and Michael Casserly&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>Renewing Our Commitment to Being All In: A Letter From the President</title>

&lt;p&gt;The events and conversations of the last few weeks remind us all that we have a long way to go to become the fairer, stronger, more equitable nation that we should be. While the College Board can’t effectively address all the racial issues our country faces, we are fully committed to doing everything we can to ensure that &lt;em&gt;every &lt;/em&gt;student has access to all the academic opportunity he or she has earned and that we can provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is with a renewed sense of purpose and conviction that I write to tell you about year two of the “All In” campaign, the College Board’s effort to ensure that &lt;em&gt;every &lt;/em&gt;African American, Latino, and Native American student who shows potential to succeed in an AP subject takes at least one corresponding, or matched, AP course. Currently, only about half of these students are enrolled in the AP courses for which they have shown potential even though the majority of these students attend schools that offer the classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the campaign will not begin in earnest until January, when schools reopen after the holiday break, there is already a great deal of exciting and important work under way. Here are some of the most recent examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The state of &lt;strong&gt;Delaware&lt;/strong&gt; has committed to the campaign as a part of its “Getting to Zero” initiative.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;University of California&lt;/strong&gt; system has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-college-board-expand-partnership-reach-underrepresented-students&quot;&gt;joined the campaign&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Pittsburgh school district&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2014/11/28/Pittsburgh-programs-pushes-blacks-to-take-advanced-high-school-courses/stories/201411260138&quot;&gt;already on the move&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pittsburgh is just one of 61 school districts that, through the &lt;strong&gt;Council of the Great City Schools&lt;/strong&gt; (CGCS), has committed to ensuring that all young men of color with AP potential enroll in matched AP classes. I was honored to deliver the keynote at the CGCS national conference this year. Following the conference, Mike Casserly, executive director of CGCS, and I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/membership/all-access/academic/letter-cgcs-superintendents-david-coleman-and-michael-casserly&quot;&gt;sent a joint letter&lt;/a&gt; to the superintendents and created a primer on boosting the enrollment of students of color in AP classes that highlights strong AP equity work in &lt;strong&gt;Hillsborough County, Fla.; Houston ISD, Texas; Long Beach Unified School District, Calif.; Montgomery County, Md.; and New Haven, Conn. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our own members are also fully engaged in year two of All In. In November, &lt;strong&gt;College Board New England Regional Council member Nancy Barile &lt;/strong&gt;moderated &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegeboardtraining.webex.com/collegeboardtraining/lsr.php?RCID=e3d031570cf141718ef0bc6a08ccd293&quot;&gt;a terrific webinar&lt;/a&gt; on successful strategies to boost the enrollment of students of color in AP classes. Webinar speakers included &lt;strong&gt;George Henry&lt;/strong&gt;, an AP U.S. History teacher since 1985 and an AP Reader since 1991 who currently serves on the &lt;strong&gt;Academic Advisory Committee&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Beth Arey&lt;/strong&gt;, who currently serves the College Board as chair-elect for the &lt;strong&gt;Midwestern Regional&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Council&lt;/strong&gt;; and&lt;strong&gt; Joanne Lang&lt;/strong&gt;, executive vice president of Kentucky Science and Technology Corporation and executive director of AdvanceKentucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s all &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the campaign gets under way! There’s lots more to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming majority of the good work that has already happened and will continue springs not from those of us who work at the College Board, but from the resolve and activism of educators and administrators in every part of this country. The College Board’s goal for All In is to support and amplify the work of those women and men who, day in and day out, work at their schools and in their districts to deliver more fairness and opportunity to students of color.  It’s my honor to support their efforts and the students whom they serve. If you’ve not already taken action to eliminate the AP participation gap in your community or at your school, I urge you to join me in supporting the educators in your community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Coleman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Renewing Our Commitment to Being All In: A Letter From the President&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The fellowship is designed to recognize, support, and reward rising leaders from African American, Latino, and Native American backgrounds who are working effectively to close achievement and attainment gaps in their schools, colleges, and communities across the country. By highlighting and supporting these leaders, the College Board is seeking to reinforce its commitment to the essential work of propelling all students forward into opportunities and success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a collaborative process that included over 50 staff readers from across the organization as well as the full senior leadership team, 21 fellows were selected to receive one-time awards of $5,000 to sustain their ongoing, high-impact efforts. Fifteen fellows from the inaugural cohort were able to attend the 2014 College Board National Forum in Las Vegas. Along with attending sessions and meetings with many of the volunteer staff who read their applications, fellows also had an opportunity on October 28&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; to meet with David Coleman, members of the senior leadership, and quite a few of our Trustees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meet and greet on October 28&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; at the ARIA hotel was amazing. Fellows were able to share their work with the senior leadership of our organization and really talk about how their grant awards were pushing forward opportunities for students of color both in K–12 and higher education. Fellows are working on a range of issues and tackling many of the pervasive problems in our education system in fresh and creative ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are excited about the success of this limited, first-year pilot and hope to widen the scope of the program next year. Below is a complete list of our inaugural fellows, who will be profiled in a series of All Access posts during the next few weeks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Albert Brass Jr.&lt;/strong&gt; Advanced Placement Program Coordinator at Joliet West High School (Joliet, IL)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deshonna Collier-Goubil&lt;/strong&gt; Assistant Professor, Department of Sociology, Biola University (La Mirada, CA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Savanna Flakes&lt;/strong&gt; Inclusion Specialist, Alexandria City Public Schools (Alexandria, VA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reagan Flowers&lt;/strong&gt; President and CEO of CSTEM (Houston, TX)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James DeLano Ford&lt;/strong&gt; Deputy Superintendent, Louisiana Recovery School District (New Orleans, LA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nneka Fritz&lt;/strong&gt; President and Lead Consultant, Higher Ground Education Consulting (Brooklyn, NY)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elizabeth Garcia&lt;/strong&gt; Dean of Multicultural Affairs, Connecticut College (New London, CT)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tomeka Hart&lt;/strong&gt; Vice President, Programs of the Southern Education Foundation (Atlanta, GA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elijah Heckstall&lt;/strong&gt; Dean of Students, Excel Academy Charter School (Chelsea, MA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoelene Hill&lt;/strong&gt;  Ph.D. student at Duke University, Sanford School of Public Policy (Durham, NC)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efrain Mercado&lt;/strong&gt; Policy Director at California County Superintendents Educational Services Association (Sacremento, CA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isabel Morales&lt;/strong&gt; Doctoral Candidate, University of Southern California; Founding Teacher, Los Angeles High School of the Arts (Los Angeles, CA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Perry&lt;/strong&gt; School Design Fellow, Expanded Success Initiative (ESI), NYC Department of Education (Brooklyn, NY)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harry Preston&lt;/strong&gt; STEM Teacher, Edmondson Westside High School, (Baltimore, MD)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kalimah Priforce&lt;/strong&gt; Cofounder, Qeyno Labs (Oakland, CA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daphne L.

School Counseling Department Chair Jeremy Goldman and junior De’Aja Davis from Pikesville High School in Pikesville, MD were joined by Guidance Department Chair Claudette Reid and senior Shatoria Forte from Blake High School in Tampa, FL to discuss about the role that school counselors play to get more students of color to &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/k-12/all-in&quot;&gt; enroll in Advanded Placement (AP) courses &lt;/a&gt; . Jennifer Dunn, Director of Membership Mobilization at the College Board moderated the lively discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy and De’Aja discussed Pikesville’s #PHSfit initiative, the importance of using digital resources, and a powerful partnership with AVID—just a few specific strategies that the Maryland high school has implemented to increase AP enrollment for African American, Latino, and Native American students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claudette outlined several strategies that have worked for her students at Blake, and focused on the importance of the performing arts school’s Open Access approach to AP. Shatoria recounted her own experiences in her AP classes, and offered advice for students not sure where to start when it comes to taking AP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of our celebration of National School Counselor Week, we encourage you to listen to a recording of the webinar &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegeboardtraining.webex.com/collegeboardtraining/lsr.php?RCID=454fad3f200362ee2a042f048d5c4922&quot;&gt; here &lt;/a&gt; , and share your own stories about going &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/k-12/all-in&quot;&gt; All In &lt;/a&gt; at your school. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collegeboard.org/all-access/submit-article&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Contribute now to All Access! &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Listen Now!

I am really not that out of touch with the wonders of technology, I just get busy working with the kids and forget about all the new things that could really make my life — and especially my teaching life — better. So, here goes … my first blog — whatever that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I live in Salt Lake City and teach at East High School, which has, over the years, changed demographically from an upper-middle class, fairly universally white school to an inner-city school with a population of 2,000 students, 62 percent of whom are students of color (mostly Hispanic) and about 55 percent of whom qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. I have been teaching for 39 years in three public schools and one private school in Salt Lake City. Originally, I went to East High to teach in the at-risk program, but the principal knew (as does everybody in Salt Lake City) that for the majority of my career, dating back to 1985 or ‘86, I taught AP United States History. So when the AP teacher retired earlier than expected — in midyear, no less — guess who, in January of 2013, became the AP U.S. History teacher?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I inherited two sections of AP U.S. History, with about 40 kids in each class (don’t gasp, this is Utah, where we “stack ‘em deep, and teach ‘em cheap”). There were about eight students of color in both AP classes combined. As a school, we had been talking about how to get our minority students to participate in AP, but frankly, it was mostly lip service. So, as a person of color,  I decided that the enrollment in AP U.S. History for the 2013-14 school year had to be exactly like that of our school — 62 percent students of color.  I only kind of knew what I had gotten myself into; the enrollment was actually the easy part. First, I asked for a list of all the students in 10th-grade World History, about 425 students. Next, I sent letters to the students and their parents explaining what AP is and why the students should take my course. Then, I identified the minority students and met with them individually, explaining why they needed to take AP U.S. History. If students were reluctant to sign up for the course, I made phone calls and home visits to the parents, registration cards in hand. What I learned was that many of the students had heard of AP, but believed that it was “too hard” for them. Many told me flat out that AP was “only for white kids.” In reality, most were afraid of failing and had incorporated what they had heard from other students into their self-image.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, the new school year started, with 185 students enrolled in AP U.S. History, 30 percent of them students of color; not the goal, but a significant improvement. Then, the real work started. I found that students didn’t read well or enough, so I used a number of strategies from the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vertical Teams Guide for Social Studies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In addition, I used the strategies from the old “Building Success” workshop, renamed “Strategies for Social Studies and Language Arts Teachers.” Specifically, I used the Levels of Questions strategy as a place to start. Next, we used the SOAPS strategy. One of the first assignments was to read “The Strange Death of Silas Deane” from a collection called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;After the Fact.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; This article helps students to understand that history isn’t just the past, it’s how historians view and write &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; the past, and how they make selections about what should be included in history books. Next, we read a primary source (the police report) about the shooting of Trayvon Martin. I asked students if they thought that justice was served in the George Zimmerman trial. Once students got into the primary sources — studying conflicting sources, offering their inferences and opinions, and collaboratively discussing the evidence — they were hooked.  From that point in the school year, the intellectual spark was lit, and we worked like we were on fire. I never focused much attention on taking the AP Exam — I didn’t want to create negative energy or stress. More than anything, the minority students in particular needed to believe in themselves — that they could actually do the work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A friend of mine who is a professional photographer took pictures of every student, and under the headings “I Am Smart,” “I Am Talented,” and “I Can Achieve,” we placed 8 x 10 glossy color prints of each student. We called it the Wall of Fame.  Were they prepared for AP? No. Was much of the work they did of AP quality? Eventually. My goal was to set the bar higher but not too high; like teaching kids to ride a bicycle, I raised the training wheels a bit every month. Every paper they wrote could be rewritten for a higher grade.  We worked on critical reading skills, outlining, Cornell notes, and conceptual identifications. I held after-school seminars for one hour every Wednesday and Thursday, offering extra credit (a concept I hate) if kids would come. By October, I was working 80 hours per week, so I enlisted the help of my university students (I teach history part time at the University of Utah) to help score papers and tutor kids during class and after school. I awarded good grades for effort more than content, encouraging students to rewrite. I used lots of primary documents, real historical dilemmas, funny YouTube videos, and lots of positive encouragement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the course of the school year, only one student had dropped the class. In May, 80 of my students took the AP Exam. I don’t know how they did — but that isn’t exactly the point. The goal was to build self-esteem and confidence; to help the students realize that college-level work is more about commitment and effort than about being smart or, for that matter, white. For some, just completing the course was a victory; for others, taking the test was a victory. Some may actually earn scores of 3 or above.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next year, there will be 205 students — about 35 percent of whom are students of color —enrolled in AP U.S. History at my school going through essentially the same process as this past year but with the help of Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) teachers, who are trained in helping underachieving students with high academic potential to succeed. What I’ve learned from this experience is that first, students must develop confidence in their abilities; second, they need constant positive encouragement. Teachers need to be ready and willing to work with students of all academic levels, and to be ready to implement individual strategies and assignments as needed.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I reflect on this school year, I am so exhausted that I can hardly believe that in about eight short weeks, I will be at it again, with a completely new energy and with a new AP U.S. History course to implement. At least, I hope I will have new energy — &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; energy would be welcomed at this point, but thankfully that’s why we have the summer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Teacher Talk: Reflections on AP® Participation from Salt Lake City, UT &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;As part of our Access to Opportunity&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; program, the goal of All In is to enroll 100 percent of students who have demonstrated that they are likely to succeed in AP in at least one AP course.  Since December, we’ve reached out to parents, teachers, counselors, principals, and the students themselves to encourage those students to take at least one AP class next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, All In sent a letter to parents with a checklist of easy steps to help enroll their children in AP. In that letter, we asked parents to respond and let us know if they were interested in expanding AP opportunities not only for their children but for other African American, Latino, and Native American students in their communities. The response was heartening. Almost 1,000 parents indicated that they wanted to become involved in the work of the All In campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also reached parents by partnering with the Michele Stephenson and Joe Brewster, the filmmakers responsible for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/pov/americanpromise/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Promise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; documentary, by creating informational packets on African American male participation in AP. These packets were distributed at parties organized around the PBS airing of the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We contacted superintendents, principals, teachers, and counselors, asking them to be proactive in reaching out to students likely to succeed in AP to encourage them to take AP classes, and the reaction of these education professionals was also strong. The College Board’s Social Justice in-box was flooded with amazing stories about how these practitioners were able to dramatically increase AP enrollment among African American, Latino, and Native American students in their schools and districts. The overwhelming professional response prompted us to plan a webinar in April where educators shared their best All In practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have involved students not only through parents and school staff but also through our targeted social media and email campaigns. We were able to leverage the star power of Shonda Rhimes, creator of &lt;em&gt;Scandal &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Grey’s Anatomy, &lt;/em&gt;Richard Sherman of the Seattle Seahawks, and David Johns, executive director of the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans, who shared their AP experiences. All In’s targeted social media efforts on Twitter, Facebook, and Pandora brought over 10,000 visitors to our website. Students heard over and over again — from sources they trust — that they have not only the potential to succeed in AP classes but also the support of parents, teachers, counselors, and administrators to thrive in those classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, we were able to call a sample of the parents and students to whom we reached out via snail mail and email. The responses were encouraging. For example, of those contacted, 89 percent of the parents and 84 percent of the students were aware of the students’ AP potential. Eighty-six percent of the students and 81 percent of the parents said that they had already taken or would take the steps needed for AP class enrollment in the 2014-15 school year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a long way to go, and we look forward to continue moving the needle for high-performing African American, Latino, and Native American students.

Because many of my Advanced Placement Program&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; students are African American and Hispanic/Latino and because I have achieved success both in enrollment and achievement, I am honored to share some of the techniques and programs that have been effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our district, any child who is identified by the College Board as having &lt;a href=&quot;https://appotential.collegeboard.org/app/welcome.do&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“AP potential”&lt;/a&gt; is automatically placed in AP classes. Although this is an easy way of increasing enrollment and certainly has increased the number of minority students in our AP classes, unfortunately some of the students feel they are being forced to take classes. I believe there are more effective ways of encouraging the desire for excellence that involve not only rigor but also fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective tools for encouraging a climate of academia within our district was implementing AP Vertical Teams&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;. I served as Team Leader for the AP Vertical Team for English. When we operated with a team approach, we saw immediate and significant growth in our program. English teachers in grades 6–12 met monthly, and we set up and conducted our own workshops during the summer. We also participated as a group at several College Board–sponsored &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/prof-dev/workshops&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;workshops&lt;/a&gt;. Working together gave us a common language, a common purpose, and a shared vision of how to navigate our curriculum to truly reflect the movement from Pre-AP&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; to AP. We became invested in the students who we collectively identified as early as sixth grade and then followed their progress right through graduation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To encourage community involvement in our AP program, our Vertical Team held AP Saturday sessions. These fun and educational workshops were open to students (and their parents) identified as having AP potential. These Saturday sessions were always well attended and included the ever-popular pizza party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the most successful ways of encouraging minority students to participate in our program was the launch of “TEAM AP.” We held a T-shirt design contest that challenged students to develop a T-shirt that would rival the team-spirit shirts our school athletes wear before their games. The winning design was developed incorporated into the Team AP shirt that TEAM AP members wore every Friday. We handed out T-shirts to all potential AP students and their teachers from grades 6 to 12, which enhanced our homegrown version of academic team building. Even kids who had no interest in AP were very interested in how they could “get one of those shirts.” I currently teach students who still have the shirt that they received in sixth grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I made it a point to attend every professional development opportunity offered by College Board. The Summer Institutes and my attendance at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apac.collegeboard.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AP Annual Conference&lt;/a&gt; significantly changed and shaped the way I approach recruitment and the way I teach the course itself. Probably the professional highlight of my entire teaching career was being selected to &lt;a href=&quot;https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/professional-development/become-an-ap-reader&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;score&lt;/a&gt; the AP English Language and Composition Exam. It is impossible to put into words how significant and invaluable that experience was for me as an educator. Suffice it to say it is something I would encourage all AP teachers to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The president joined distinguished guests, including NBA All-Star Chris Paul, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, and Deputy Secretary of Education Jim Shelton, to discuss the opportunities and persistent challenges that face young men of color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board, one of several organizations that have pledged their support for this initiative, was recognized for its &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/k-12/all-in&quot;&gt;“All In” campaign&lt;/a&gt;, which works to ensure that African American, Latino, and Native American students have access to the Advanced Placement Program&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (AP&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;) and other rigorous academic opportunities. Three AP student representatives who exemplify how such access can lead to lifelong learning and success were invited to participate in a town hall session with President Obama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derrick Simmons&lt;/strong&gt;, a recent graduate of Howard University with a degree in mathematics, is working on his teaching degree from American University and will begin student teaching at Dunbar High School in Washington this fall. He took eight AP Exams in high school and was one of the very few African American males in the country to receive an AP Scholar with Honor distinction from the College Board.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julius Figueroa &lt;/strong&gt;graduated from West Leyden High School just outside of Chicago and plans to major in philosophy at Columbia University this fall. He took six AP courses in high school, often speaks about learning for learning’s sake, and created a self-directed independent study to read important philosophy texts. In addition to participating in the town hall, Julius was featured on a panel along with the CEO of AT&amp;amp;T and a superintendent representing the Council of the Great City Schools, where they discussed linking education to workforce training and future employment.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luis Jose Hernandez &lt;/strong&gt;cites his AP Environmental Science class as his most impactful academic experience, and he will study science at Fordham University this fall. Luis was raised in the South Bronx by Dominican immigrant parents who did not attend college but who pushed him to excel in school to escape poverty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Brother’s Keeper is part of the new Presidential Task Force to Expand Opportunity. According to the White House, “The president believes this includes ensuring access to basic health [and] nutrition and to high-quality early education to get these kids reading and ready for school at the youngest age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board is solidifying its partnership with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cgcs.org/&quot;&gt;Council of the Great City Schools&lt;/a&gt; to dramatically increase the proportion of African American, Latino, and Native American students with AP potential who are enrolled in AP classes. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Going ‘All In’ for Our Nation’s Students of Color</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the last 10 years, the College Board’s Advanced Placement expansion efforts have nearly doubled the number of students who have been given access to the opportunities AP repeatedly proves to offer, including greater college preparedness and potential cost and time-savings through credit-granting policies. We are especially proud that low-income students have made up a significant part of that growth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we still have a long way to go. The PSAT/NMSQT® is currently the best indicator of a student’s potential to succeed in certain AP courses. But last year alone there were nearly 300,000 students with this potential who didn’t take an AP course for which they were qualified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap between earning the opportunity and seizing it is most pronounced among traditionally underserved minority populations. For example, only 3 out of 10 African-American students with high potential for success in AP science course work take an AP science course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One essential approach is to continue to bring AP into schools with these academically prepared and motivated students, particularly those with large minority and low-income student populations. To that end, we have developed partnerships with the Michael &amp;amp; Susan Dell Foundation to launch &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/initiatives/ap-opportunity-program&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(255, 120, 0);&quot;&gt;150 new AP courses &lt;/a&gt;reaching more than 9,000 low-income students in the next three years, and with Google and DonorsChoose.org to create 500 new &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/initiatives/ap-stem-access-program&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(255, 120, 0);&quot;&gt;AP STEM&lt;/a&gt; courses in public schools and enable more women and minorities to excel in science and math. The latter project enabled 10,000 students who did not previously have access to AP courses to take AP exams this past May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ironically, our greatest challenge may be to get more qualified students into AP classes in schools where AP already exists. A shocking two-thirds of students with AP potential who do not take AP classes attend schools that do in fact offer AP in their curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons are complex and manifold, but one thing is clear. According to public opinion research, the most powerful factor that turns a potential AP student into a registered AP student is the spirited encouragement and enthusiastic support of a teacher, counselor, or school administrator. In other words, adults who work in schools have enormous influence and can, by reaching out to a student with AP potential and encouraging her or him to take AP classes, quite literally change the education trajectory of that student. In schools with high percentages of underrepresented students, the cumulative impact can be incalculable. That’s why we started “&lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/k-12/all-in&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(255, 120, 0);&quot;&gt;All In&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All In is a College Board campaign that aims to unite educators, administrators, communities, and students themselves in an effort to ensure that every African-American, Latino, and Native American student with AP potential enrolls in at least one AP class and that every ounce of talent is given the chance to blossom instead of wither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In creating All In, we have been inspired by the hundreds of schools and districts that have already made enormous progress by supporting teacher professional development, removing financial barriers, aligning curriculum and instruction, and so much more. And we honor those that have made a concerted effort to identify and recruit students with AP potential, like last year’s Advanced Placement Large District of the Year winner, Texas’s North East Independent School District. Sheila Richards, one of its AP English teachers, describes the overall approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of our goals is to find students who might not otherwise participate in the program and to bring them in and assure them that we, the adults, are there to help them. We’re the support system and we’re going to use all the tools in the toolbox to make sure that they find success; (we tell the students) yes, it’s difficult, and, yes, you’ll be challenged, but we’re going to be there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invite you to be there for students as well by visiting our &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/k-12/all-in&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(255, 120, 0);&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, joining the All In campaign, and helping us get &lt;em&gt;every single qualified student&lt;/em&gt; into those AP classrooms. We want all in. No exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want all in because we believe that access to opportunity is as inalienable a right as the pursuit of happiness. And for a large portion of our nation’s youth, AP is what gives them a running start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s what led West Leyden High School Class of ’14 graduate Julius Figueroa to speak on a distinguished White House panel last week to discuss how AP paved the way for his acceptance to Columbia University this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s what inspired Derrick Simmons, who just graduated from Howard University, to go on to pursue a graduate teaching degree at American University while teaching math to low-income minority students in a Washington, D.C., high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s what has made—and continues to make—opportunity and success realities for countless thousands of students. But until these realities are in the vision and reach of every student—regardless of race, background, or family income—our satisfaction with what we have accomplished must be tempered by our obligation to do more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We share that obligation with the educators, counselors, and administrators at the literal doorsteps of our nation’s youth. We hope that, by joining All In, you will open those doors with the materials, knowledge, and strategies that will help every one of your students step confidently into the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Going ‘All In’ for Our Nation’s Students of Color&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

This is our annual time to reflect on what makes the difference. Kentucky was one of the ‘pioneer states’ selected by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nms.org/Programs/CollegeReadinessProgram.aspx&quot;&gt;National Math and Science Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (NMSI) to replicate its proven AP Teacher Training and Incentive Program. As a result,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.advancekentucky.com/&quot;&gt; AdvanceKentucky&lt;/a&gt; was created as an initiative of Kentucky Science and Technology Corporation in partnership with Kentucky Department of Education and NMSI and several other funding partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Often I’m asked “What’s the one element that has made the most difference in the extraordinary Advanced Placement (AP) gains among AdvanceKentucky schools?” They are speaking of what we affectionately call our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.advancekentucky.com/our-program/elements-of-success&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.4285; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;Wheel of Success&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; – the integrated support systems for students and their teachers proven by NMSI. The system offers an open enrollment approach to AP that is grounded in high expectations and soft landings that make it ‘safe’ for both teachers and students to try and if necessary try again. We know, after eight cohorts of participating Kentucky high schools, that adopting all of the elements of the NMSI model simultaneously is essential. The key is an inherent belief that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;many more&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; high school students can perform at AP levels.  And the AdvanceKentucky team starts each year with the collective expectation that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;many more&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; students from our participating schools, particularly those traditionally underrepresented in AP, will earn qualifying scores on the next AP exams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So far in 92 schools, with almost 700 AP math, science and English (MSE) teachers supporting some 70,000 AP MSE enrollees, we’ve seen many permutations on how this shift in open enrollment thinking can be translated into sustainable, locally relevant practices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Adopting open enrollment recruitment strategies is insufficient without a review of policies and practices.   Here are some examples of both immediate and long-term considerations – some that don’t require funding and others that might benefit from reassigning existing funds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As we shift our focus to how we can help many more students to participate in AP, do any policies inadvertently discourage students from even asking about AP – and how do we know this?  For example, do our summer assignments offer inviting preparation options or are they written in a way that ultimately discourages students from even asking about AP?  Are ‘late bloomers’ made to feel welcome in AP?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Know the profile of students that earned a ‘2’ on the most recent AP exams.  Know well what it would have taken for the majority of them to earn a qualifying score and think of these as strategic opportunities to enhance student learning – not as ‘failures’.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider creative scheduling, if possible.  For example, is it feasible to offer AP Biology for 10th graders so that access to AP math and science courses isn’t limited to junior and senior years?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look for added supports that the school could provide to students. Might we make it a priority to offer study hall for AP students throughout the day for extra help? Can we arrange extended school services for transportation for extra help before or after school? Now that we’ve broadened access, how will we help subsidize exam fees?   Are our labs equipped sufficiently for &lt;em&gt;many more&lt;/em&gt; students to ‘do’ science at the AP level?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are teacher evaluations in any way based on AP ‘pass rates’ (i.e., the number of qualifying scores earned divided by the number of AP exams taken)?  While perhaps somewhat counterintuitive, placing a ‘value’ on pass rates actually incents a ‘selective’ enrollment environment. This practice may inadvertently discourage a teacher from recruiting &lt;em&gt;many more&lt;/em&gt; students to enroll in his/her AP class and it can unconsciously dampen the level of enthusiasm for encouraging students to sit for the AP exam.  Strive relentlessly for strong pass rates but be ready for them to perhaps take a dip while simultaneously increasing the number of students receiving qualifying scores.  Over time we see instances where these rates return to baseline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set quantifiable growth goals for numbers of qualifying scores for a school and individual teachers compared to their own prior performance.  What constitutes &lt;em&gt;many more&lt;/em&gt; students in a high school of 2,000 with AP experience is vastly different than in a school of 750 or even less than 500 total students enrolled and little or no AP experience.  One size does not fit all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never stop training teachers to enhance their &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; knowledge.  Kentucky recently enjoyed access to five weeks of local APSIs, more than double the access when AdvanceKentucky began. Reach out to university partners willing to step up to respond to a growing demand for this training. For teachers who are willing to take on the open enrollment approach find them mentors who have successfully embraced open enrollment and who know well the challenges of making this shift and sustaining student success.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pay attention to the teachers of AP feeder classes and team them with AP teachers.  It’s not coincidental that almost 3,000 Kentucky MSE teachers of feeder, Pre-AP classes among our middle and high schools have received multi-year &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; training by Kentucky educators who are NMSI-endorsed national trainers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fundamental shift in approach needs thoughtful orientation and plenty of time for reflection and discussion followed by action planning and goal setting. A successful shift requires a team approach in which healthy skepticism forces the team to ask all the ‘what if’ questions and reflect on locally relevant solutions.  These are embraced only with sufficient time, which is why we begin working with interested schools almost a year in advance of formal implementation. It takes time to take a fresh, in-depth look at student data and review policies and practices that inadvertently may be discouraging AP participation – despite best intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, take seriously the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sduhsd.net/documents/Parents%20and%20Students/Special%20Programs/Access_Equity_4.10.6.1.pdf&quot;&gt;College Board Equity and Access Policy&lt;/a&gt; but figure out what this means to your local circumstances. It takes a team to open enrollment in AP and sustain high expectations for students and teachers. At the risk of oversimplifying a major policy challenge, is your goal to filter students &lt;em&gt;out of&lt;/em&gt; an AP class because they’re not ‘ready’ – or to embrace high expectations through open enrollment whereby we deliberately look for signals to&lt;em&gt; include&lt;/em&gt; students even if you know they will need support from the wheel of success?  Likewise, do your policies and practices strive for resulting in more students ‘enrolling’ in college or for more that are so well prepared with the ‘AP experience’ that &lt;em&gt;many more&lt;/em&gt; students ‘graduate’ from college with a credential?  The policy direction you take matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measuring Success                 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think this scenario is nice but not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; answer, I agree.  However, evidence suggests that it is &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt; answer for addressing college readiness and helping to close the gap among students traditionally underrepresented in AP. Please keep reading for the measurable impact that only about one-third of Kentucky’s public high schools with open enrollment have had on advancing the state’s overall AP standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the first five years after AdvanceKentucky was introduced Kentucky overall experienced a 100 percent increase in number of AP qualifying scores in all subjects and 137 percent increase in  underrepresented minority qualifying scores -- compared to US increases of 49 percent and 88 percent respectively. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The number of AP Scholars statewide increased roughly 350 percent during this same timeframe.  With dramatic acceleration in AP MSE access, participation and performance, we have seen student interest spilling over to other AP subjects and contributing to Kentucky’s overall position among the top states in qualifying score increases from 2008-2013; and 2014 results promise to be just as encouraging.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kentucky’s AP MSE qualifying scores increased 105 percent and minority qualifying scores by 180 percent.  In math-science only, minority scores increased 183 percent.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;About one-third of participating AdvanceKentucky schools is located in the rural Appalachian region, which has kept pace with 100 percent increases among these rural schools.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Among schools that have participated for a standard three-year intervention, they earned an average 229 percent increase in AP MSE qualifying scores, while qualifying scores earned by low income students increased an average 424 percent and an average 411 percent in scores earned by minority students.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the Kentucky Center for Education and Workforce Statistics released an independent research study that examined the longitudinal impact of our approach on the initial 10,500 students of AdvanceKentucky vs a control group. This study found that more AdvanceKentucky students enrolled in college and far fewer of them enrolled in college remedial classes (and there was almost negligible remediation for students earning qualifying scores). The same benefit was demonstrated among AdvanceKentucky students who were from underrepresented minority and low income populations. The study will be updated annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;UC’s Early Academic Outreach Program (EAOP) will work with the College Board’s Western Regional Office on its “All In” campaign, designed to eliminate academic barriers for low-income African American, Latino and American Indian high school students who show potential to enroll in advanced-level courses, such as Advanced Placement (AP) classes. These efforts include expanding the numbers of such students who take the PSAT/NMSQT, a standardized pre-college entrance exam.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“At the University of California, we want all qualified students to be aware of the academic experiences available to them and get an early start on planning and preparing for college,” said UC President Janet Napolitano. “That includes taking preliminary college entrance exams and enrolling in academically-challenging courses that can help prepare students for college and increase their chances for admission at UC.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the class of 2014, 49 percent of California students took the PSAT/NMSQT, and 35 percent of test-takers in California demonstrated potential for success in one or more AP classes. Yet, of those PSAT/NMSQT takers with AP potential, 31 percent did not take a matched AP course.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The “All In” campaign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; will bring awareness, training and advising to parents and high school students across California about the advantages of taking the PSAT/NMSQT and advanced-level high school courses, with the goal of increasing student participation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The College Board believes that all students should have access to the opportunities they have earned,” said Amy Wilkins, College Board senior fellow for social justice and director of the All In Campaign. “We are delighted that the University of California is also working on breaking down barriers for underrepresented minority students who show the potential to succeed in AP classes. We hope that other institutions of higher education will follow their lead.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The PSAT/NMSQT provides an early assessment of the reading, math and writing skills required for college. In addition to allowing students to practice test-taking strategies, the test helps students enter scholarship competitions like National Merit, provides opportunity for them to be recruited into AP courses offered locally, and connects students with important academic services like free online college and career exploration programs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The “All In” campaign will also provide educators with resources related to AP courses, including a list of students at their schools who demonstrated potential to perform well in advanced-level classes. With these resources, UC staff will work directly with school districts in Fresno, the Inland Empire, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Oakland, Sacramento, San Diego and San Francisco.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last spring, UC President Janet Napolitano reached out to thousands of low-income California high school students who were among the state’s top performers on the PSAT/NMSQT, encouraging them to pursue higher education at the university and take academically-challenging courses that could increase their chances of UC admission. The letter was part of UC’s partnership with the College Board, and targeted students whose PSAT/NMSQT scores demonstrated their ability to do advanced academic work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the letter, Napolitano also told students about the university’s Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan, which covers system-wide tuition and fees for California resident students who qualify for financial aid, and whose total family incomes are less than $80,000 a year. More than half of UC students who are California residents pay no tuition and fees thanks to the Blue and Gold program and other financial aid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In a morning colloquium, College Board Associate Director of Social Justice Nicole Young and two former high school teachers -- Colorado State Representative James Wilson and Towson University Professor of Mathematics Gail Kaplan – discussed innovative projects aimed at providing more students with the access and the will to challenge themselves academically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rep. Wilson shed light on the severely limited access of rural students to AP classes. He noted that of the 179 public school districts in Colorado, 101 offer no AP classes. To begin to give rural students their equal due, he sponsored Colorado HB14-1118, an Advanced Placement Incentives Pilot Program to expand access to AP classes in rural schools, as well as to students who participate in the school lunch program. The bill was signed into law in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though bringing AP to more schools is essential, said Young, it’s just one factor in increasing access.  Pointing out that many students with AP potential don’t take AP classes even in schools where AP exists, Young outlined the College Board’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/k-12/all-in&quot;&gt;All In&lt;/a&gt; campaign, designed to effect a cultural shift and ensure that 100% of African American, Latino, and Native American students with AP Potential enroll in at least one matched AP class. Because teenagers may not recognize their own talent, or because they may feel intimidated by or not recognize the value of AP, All In calls upon the adults in students’ lives – including teachers, counselors, principals, and superintendents – to provide ongoing encouragement and support to help them succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Kaplan offered an example of a program created to solve another issue of access: the sheer difficulty of achieving and sustaining success in teaching and learning rigorous course material.  Using AP Calculus as the initial focus, she helped launch Towson’s Access to Rigor Collaboration with local school districts in Maryland to offer enhanced training for teachers, summer “boot camps” for students, and a pilot program aimed at awarding credentials for pre-service teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colloquium was moderated by Ted Gardella, Executive Director of AP Strategy &amp;amp; Professional Development at the College Board, who also discussed other College Board partnerships that are delivering increased access to AP and other challenging courses. These include &lt;a href=&quot;https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/initiatives/ap-stem-access-program&quot;&gt;AP STEM Access&lt;/a&gt;, a partnership with Google and DonorsChoose.org, and AP Opportunity, a partnership with the Michael &amp;amp; Susan Dell Foundation. We encourage you to inquire and learn about these and all the great work being done to increase access to AP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Colloquium Recap: Access to Challenging Coursework&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The young men — all successful AP&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Exam takers from the Washington, D.C., metro area — were there to share their experiences and insights with administration officials charged with overseeing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/my-brothers-keeper&quot;&gt;My Brother’s Keeper initiative&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The young men were remarkably thoughtful, well-spoken, honest, and often funny in recounting their stories. The stories they told reflected the full range of the American experience, touching on immigration, financial hardship, economically secure two-parent households, grave family illness, high-wealth suburban schools, and under-resourced city schools. The administration officials — all men of color themselves — engaged respectfully with the young men and shared their own backgrounds. And, if they were listening carefully, the officials heard the same themes that the All In program has identified through public opinion research: the critical role that adults who work in schools play in shaping students’ expectations for and of themselves; and the isolation that is often felt by high-achieving students of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maghan, in his opening remarks and throughout the two-hour meeting, deftly and repeatedly struck the “own your future” chord. Then he took it further, challenging the young men to not only own their own future but also embrace the responsibility of truly being their brother’s keeper. Being their brother’s keeper means reaching out to high-ability peers and encouraging them to take rigorous courses, and providing lowerclassmen with support. The young men responded to Maghan’s challenge, calling themselves “agents of my brother’s keeper,” and looked to the College Board to help them find ways to serve other young African American, Latino, and Native American men. We’ll keep you posted on how well we do in meeting their expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meeting was held in the Indian Treaty room of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building — a room sheathed in marble with a soaring ceiling — widely thought to be one of the grandest rooms in the White House complex. After the meeting, the young men viewed ever-grander and more historic rooms as they enjoyed a private tour of the White House. Some who lagged behind even caught a glimpse of Bo, the Obama family’s dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a day the young men will likely remember for a long time. Perhaps even more important, the officials who attended the meeting seem to have found it valuable — valuable enough that as the College Board group departed, there was talk of holding similar meetings in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following young men attended the October 27 meeting:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adrian Ernesto Jiminez&lt;/strong&gt;, Loudoun County High School&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Patrick Cuyjet&lt;/strong&gt;, W.T. Woodson High School&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reese Falcon Fulgenzi&lt;/strong&gt;, Loudoun County High School&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas Elliott Stone&lt;/strong&gt;, United States Naval Academy (previously from Mount Hebron High School)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phillip Dean Hilliard&lt;/strong&gt;, River Hill High School&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soulihe Jemal Nida&lt;/strong&gt;, University of Maryland (previously from Wheaton High School)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Randall Theophilus Crandon&lt;/strong&gt;, River Hill High School&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Francis Adebayo Oyebanjo&lt;/strong&gt;, Gwynn Park High School&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norman Morris Ellis III&lt;/strong&gt;, Woodbridge Senior High School&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kireh Terrell Wright&lt;/strong&gt;, Parkville High School&lt;/p&gt;
