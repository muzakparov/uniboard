Recent budget cuts have led to mass layoffs of counselors across many districts and states, particularly in California where, according to the U.S. Department of Education, the student-to-counselor ratio is now the highest in the country; more than 1,000 students per school counselor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the motivation for honing in on counselors as more dispensable than other staff?  Perhaps the lack of causal empirical evidence on the impact of school counselors on student outcomes is to blame.  Educational researchers have had a laser-like focus on the impact of &lt;em&gt;teachers&lt;/em&gt; through studies on class size, value-added, and the like, but there are only a few rigorous studies on the extent to which school counselors influence student outcomes and most of those focus on attendance and disciplinary issues.  Our research provides the first evidence on the causal impact of an additional high school counselor on students’ four-year college enrollment rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined three waves of data from the National Center for Education Statistics’ Schools and Staffing Survey, which collects information on teachers, principals, districts and schools in order to understand school and teacher climates, pay structures, and general perceptions of these groups’ professions.  In addition to school-level demographic characteristics, this survey also collects data on each high school’s four-year college-going rates, student enrollment, and the number of school counselors. In order to identify causal rather than just correlational effects, we analyze a subsample of states that have mandated maximum high school student-to-counselor ratios or have programs through which the states subsidize the hiring of counselors with school accreditation guidelines reinforcing these ratios. Our analyses focus on 12 states with such policies: Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Maine, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Utah, and Vermont.  The mandated student-to-counselor ratios in these states allow us to apply a methodological approach known as regression discontinuity design, which essentially focuses in on those high schools that fall on either side of each state’s mandated ratio.  Such high schools are basically identical in observable and unobservable ways &lt;em&gt;except for &lt;/em&gt;their student-to-counselor ratios, mimicking a randomized experiment. In this scenario, the treatment group can be thought of as the set of high schools with student enrollments just large enough to exceed the mandated student-to-counselor ratio, thus justifying the addition of a school counselor. The control group high schools have student-to-counselor ratios just shy of the maximum allowable ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We find that an additional high school counselor is predicted to induce up to a 10 percentage point increase in four-year college enrollment.  Among the typical sampled high school with an enrollment of 113 graduating students, our results imply that an additional high school counselor would be predicted to induce 11 more graduating seniors into four-year colleges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The College Board’s 2012 National Survey of School Counselors and Administrators revealed that more than half of high school counselors believe they should spend more time on building a college-going culture.  While our research is unable to uncover exactly why the addition of school counselors bolsters four-year college-going rates, it is consistent with counselors’ perceptions that more resources are needed to help students reach their college potential. The evidence in our study can be leveraged by counselors and administrators alike to defend claims that current counselor staffing levels are sub-optimal and that students are being penalized as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.1556-6676.2014.00159.x/abstract&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;full study&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; can be found in Michael Hurwitz and Jessica Howell, “Estimating Causal Impacts of School Counselors With Regression Discontinuity Designs”, Journal of Counseling &amp;amp; Development, Volume 92, Issue 3, pages 316–327, July 2014.

However, there is a growing body of literature showing that students are not behaving optimally in the college application and enrollment processes. For example, Amanda Pallais, in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/pallais/files/small_differences_that_matter_1.pdf&quot;&gt;Small Differences that Matter: Mistakes in Applying to College&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2013), shows that when applying to college, students often rely on rules of thumb that result in too few college applications, and Caroline Hoxby and Christopher Avery, in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/the-missing-one-offs-the-hidden-supply-of-high-achieving-low-income-students/&quot;&gt;The Missing One-Offs: The Hidden Supply of High-Achieving, Low-Income Students&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(2013), demonstrate that many high-achieving, low-income students fail to apply to or enroll in those colleges that have higher graduation rates and would likely be more affordable. Our new paper, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5c--a90k-_zMTkwdWNaRDZ6THM/view&quot;&gt;Screening Mechanisms and Student Responses in the College Market&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, offers new evidence of students responding to relatively small changes in the college application process. Specifically, we investigate the prevalence of required college application essays and the magnitude of application fees, and show how each can have sizeable effects on applications and enrollment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How often are application essays used by colleges for admission and how often do colleges increase their application fees? We answer these questions using data from the Annual Survey of Colleges on 885 four-year colleges for the entering cohorts of 2003–2011. In 2003, 49.8% of four-year colleges required an application essay, and that number increased to 56.8% by 2011 (even as some colleges dropped the essay requirement). Over the same time period, approximately 50% of colleges increased their application fees at least once. Among colleges that increased application fees, the average increase was 30%, which amounts to only about $10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do essays and application fees affect student behavior?  To answer this question, we bring in student application and enrollment data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System for the same years.  We examine the changes in application and enrollment rates at colleges that alter their admission processes (relative to trends at colleges that don’t change their admission processes).  Methodologically speaking, colleges could be changing their processes in response to previous years’ dips or spikes, so we account for that by adjusting for a measure of popularity — previous years’ number of SAT&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; score sends.  With this methodology, we find that requiring a college application essay decreases the number of applications received at that college by 6.5%. We also find that increasing the application fee by 10% corresponds to roughly a 1% decrease in applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for students, colleges, and policymakers? Students (and those advising students) shouldn’t let these small changes in cost and procedure stand in the way of what they want.  Colleges should carefully consider their admission policies and how they affect their applicant pools. Do they want fewer applicants who demonstrate that these hurdles are not going to stop them, or do they want more applicants so that they can discover a diamond in the rough?  And policymakers need to recognize that these small procedural barriers are just a few examples of how students can get tripped up in the application process, and work to simplify the process or change the entire system.  Regardless of which position one is in, one thing is clear: The college admission process matters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Research Roundup: Are Students Affected by Colleges’ Small Application Barriers?&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

There are some perfectly good reasons that low-income students make those decisions (e.g., proximity to home, financial considerations), but these choices may come at a cost.  Along with our coauthor Joshua Goodman at Harvard University, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nber.org/papers/w20996&quot;&gt;our new research&lt;/a&gt; investigates one such cost – whether starting at an academically less selective college reduces the chances of attaining a bachelor’s degree. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research harnesses a “natural experiment” that stems from the Georgia State University System (GSUS) admission criteria, which allows us to compare the degree completion outcomes of two groups of students who are similar in almost every observable way &lt;em&gt;other than&lt;/em&gt; a small test score difference that pushes one group of students into GSUS colleges and the other students into less selective colleges.  We find that students – particularly low-income students – who start at a GSUS institution are 30 percentage points more likely to attain a bachelor’s degree within six years than their nearly identical peers who start at less selective colleges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For students and those advising them in their transition into college, our result drives home the importance of carefully considering college completion rates in the college search, application, and choice processes.  Importantly, our research also demonstrates to policymakers that low institutional graduation rates are not simply a byproduct of the academic preparation that students are bringing to the college table. We have identified large institution-level gaps in the degree completion rates of identical students, indicating that it does, in fact, matter a great deal where students start their postsecondary careers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Leonhardt of the New York Times looked at this research for a recent piece that focuses on the benefits of college.

The report, titled “Student Responsiveness to Earnings Data in the College Scorecard,” uses SAT score send data to estimate how students have responded to the information and metrics the College Scorecard makes public, including a college’s annual cost, graduation rate, and median earnings after college (a metric previously unavailable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the researchers, Michael Hurwitz and Jonathan Smith: “The research we highlight…was the first opportunity to analyze whether students (and which students) used and responded to the College Scorecard data.  Our inquiry was prompted by our interest in understanding what influences students and families as they make their very important decisions about whether and where to go to college – questions at the very heart of the [College Board’s] &lt;a href=&quot;https://professionals.collegeboard.org/guidance/access-to-opportunity&quot;&gt;Access to Opportunity&lt;/a&gt; work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report, developed in collaboration with the College Board, provides policymakers, college enrollment managers, counselors, school leaders, researchers, and the media with state-by-state demographic trends, and it projects how the numbers of high school graduates are likely to change in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The denominator is important. Without descriptive statistics we don&#039;t know what is going on,” said Jack Buckley, senior vice president of research at the College Board. “The data in &lt;em&gt;Knocking at the College Door&lt;/em&gt; will prove extremely useful to our members and to other educators and policymakers as they plan for the challenges ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, now in its ninth edition, remains the only national series that includes state-level projections for students attending private schools and the most comprehensive report analyzing public high school graduates by race/ethnicity at the state and regional levels. This year, for the first time, projections were also included for Guam and Puerto Rico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key findings from the report: an overall decline in high school graduates, dramatic increases in Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander graduates, and a sharp decline in private school graduates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are moving toward a time when nearly half of all high school graduates will be students of color, with the largest increases among Hispanics and Asian/Pacific Islanders,” said Joe Garcia, president of WICHE. “Meanwhile, as our population continues to shift geographically, the states that will gain the most population will educate the highest percentage of students of color.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report, part of a series that has been released every four years for nearly four decades, is one of the most widely cited sources of comprehensive and reliable data about the future size and composition of high school graduating classes throughout the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can use the data visualization tool that accompanies the online report at &lt;a href=&quot;http://knocking.wiche.edu/&quot;&gt;knocking.wiche.edu&lt;/a&gt; to see data for specific regions, states, and demographic groups. Individual state profiles are also available for download.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;New Report Projects Number of High School Graduates across America&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>What Predicts Academic Success and Social-Emotional Health Among AP® Students? </title>

However, there has been relatively little research of this kind done with samples of high-achieving students despite the staggering growth of AP participation across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this information gap, a team of researchers from the University of South Florida (USF) sought and received a federal grant from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ies.ed.gov/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Institute of Education Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. Shannon Suldo and Elizabeth Shaunessy-Dedrick spearheaded a four-year project that fused their knowledge of school psychology and gifted education with the measurement and analysis expertise of colleagues John Ferron and Robert Dedrick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team’s earlier research with students from four schools revealed a higher level of stress among students in accelerated high school curricula compared to that of their peers in general education. This time, the team wanted to uncover the factors that could explain the success many AP students experienced despite their elevated stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Student success was conceptualized holistically, both in terms of academic success (defined as high school GPAs of 3.0 or higher and scores of 3 or higher on AP Exams) and optimal mental health (defined as feeling satisfied with life, having few symptoms of mental health disorders, and having a low level of school burnout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team interviewed AP students, parents, and AP teachers from 20 high schools in five Florida school districts. The goal was to identify the primary stressors students faced, the coping strategies students relied on, and a host of other factors (personal traits and environmental supports) that appeared to contribute to student success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After determining these stressors, the team developed an extensive survey that they administered to students in grades 9–12 who had taken AP classes in public schools. The 2,379 student participants were from a wide range of cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds; more than half were students of color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following an extensive analysis of transcribed interview data and the self-report surveys, the researchers identified several key findings. Two methods of coping — responding to academic stress through problem-solving strategies and seeking temporary diversions from the stressor — were associated with better mental health, whereas managing academic demands through avoidance, rumination, and handling problems alone predicted worse mental health. Students with better mental health also felt more connected to their teachers and their school, and they reported that their parents provided them with emotional support as well as the freedom to make their own choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students’ academic success in high school was predicted primarily by their prior academic performance history (scores on a statewide achievement test and number of high-school-level courses completed during middle school) and family socioeconomic status. Though these are not circumstances that educators can change, malleable factors such as a student’s motivation to achieve and engagement in the AP classroom (via connection to content and confidence in one’s ability to master the material) predicted better outcomes in both domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team hopes to develop curricular materials for students, teachers, and parents to help build students’ skills in using coping strategies and limiting harmful reactions when faced with academic demands, and increase students’ connections to their school, curricular program, and teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
