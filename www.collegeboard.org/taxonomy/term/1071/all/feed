  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Congratulations graduates! Completing high school and getting into college are huge achievements, and the summer is a great time to reflect on how far you’ve come. You’ve worked hard, and you’ve earned the right to enjoy yourself a little, but remember that the summer is a great time to get ready for the next big chapter of your life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Here are 10 ideas for making the most of your summer so you can hit the ground running in the fall.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  1. Put your “
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/get-in/making-a-decision/you-made-your-college-choice-whats-next&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    paperwork
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ” in order. Make sure you complete and return all the necessary forms your college sent about orientation, financial aid, housing, meal plans, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  2. Review your school’s course catalog to select classes. If you know your major,&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/find-colleges/academic-life/students-talk-about-college-classes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    choose some courses 
  &lt;/a&gt;
  that fulfill general requirements in that area.
  .
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  3. Don’t be shy about asking for help. Have questions about your&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://studentaid.ed.gov/fafsa/estimate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    financial aid
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ? Contact the financial aid office and they can&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/pay-for-college/financial-aid-101/questions-to-ask-financial-aid-officers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    answer questions
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &amp;nbsp;about topics such as&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/pay-for-college/paying-your-share/what-to-do-when-your-financial-aid-award-isnt-enough&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    receiving additional aid
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &amp;nbsp;and ways to find scholarships to help&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://studentaid.ed.gov/types&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    pay
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &amp;nbsp;for college.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  4. Plan on life beyond the classroom. Explore what extracurricular activities, teams or groups your college offers. Campus events are a great way to have fun and&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/find-colleges/campus-life/my-college-life-outside-the-classroom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    meet people
  &lt;/a&gt;
  .
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  5. Contact your roommate. Most colleges help&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/find-colleges/campus-life/college-roommates-the-basics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    roommates
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &amp;nbsp;get in touch with each other so that they can get to know each other and coordinate on what to bring.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  6. Hit the shops. Think about what&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/get-in/making-a-decision/off-to-college-checklist&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    school supplies and personal items
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &amp;nbsp;you need, want and can afford to buy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  7. Get a physical. Most incoming college students have to submit results from a recent physical exam and vaccination history before registering for classes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  8. See if you have to take any placement exams. Some standardized test scores may help you get out of placement tests, so check the testing requirements on your college’s website.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  9. Ease the transition. Some colleges offer “summer bridge” or “
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bottomline.org/content/college-support&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    college success
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ” classes that provide tutoring, cultural events and academic and financial aid counseling to&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/find-colleges/campus-life/campus-services-theres-support-when-you-need-it&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    help
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &amp;nbsp;you ease into campus life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  10. Say thanks. Your family, teachers, counselors and others probably helped you along your way to college. Let them know how much you appreciate their efforts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  One more for good measure: stay strong! Shifting from high school to college is a big move, but you have been working toward this destination and are academically ready. Being the first to go to college may be hard on your family, but know that they want the best for you. And, know that you are not alone: there are other students on campus who are walking this same path. Take full advantage of all the resources and tools available to help you on&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://roadtripnation.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    your journey
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &amp;nbsp;to college success.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;

This group of K12 and higher education educators meets regularly with College Board staff to discuss topics related to the SAT. This year with the implementation of the College Board&#039;s assessment redesign, the SAT Committee will be particularly busy. All Access caught up with Donald to discuss his term as chair, and what to expect from the Committee over the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Access: When, and why, did you first become involved with the College Board’s committees and governance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Donald Kamentz: I first joined the SAT Committee in November 2011. Having been involved in the college admission field (on both the higher ed and K–12 sides) for many years and, in particular, working with predominantly low-income, first-generation college-bound students at YES Prep Public Schools, I felt that my diverse experience could be an asset to the committee and our collective work — to ensure that our focus is on ALL students and assisting them with building their college knowledge while creating opportunities and possibilities rather than limiting them. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: Who makes up the SAT Committee, and how often does the committee meet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DK: The SAT Committee is comprised of educational professionals from both the K–12 and higher education sectors. Formally, the committee meets three times a year (in November, January, and May), with conference calls and other interactions throughout the year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: How does your involvement with the SAT Committee and the College Board influence your day-to-day work at YES Prep?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DK: I believe my day-to-day work at YES Prep directly and heavily influences my work on the SAT Committee and with the College Board, and as one would suspect, it occurs vice versa as well. The robust College Board programs and assessments that are used by YES Prep and our students, including PSAT/NMSQT, SAT, AP, and CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, all directly inform and guide our instruction in our classrooms. Equally, it’s this work in our schools that directs my focus and energies on the SAT Committee, working to ensure these programs provide much-needed support for my colleagues and students, not becoming hindrances or obstacles to postsecondary opportunities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: What are some of the overall goals of the SAT Committee for the coming two-year term?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DK: Some of our overall goals for the work of our committee over the next two years include:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advocacy for continued transparency with the redesign and all aspects of the PSAT/NMSQT and SAT programs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ongoing use of the committee members’ expertise to help guide the operational implementation, communications, and support of the redesign&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greater collaboration across the different programs and divisions within the College Board directly involved in the redesign, but on the micro and macro levels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: The redesign of the SAT and the College Board Readiness and Success System will clearly be a major focus of the committee over the next two years. How will the committee prioritize the different elements of the redesign at the right times to best serve the higher ed and K–12 communities throughout the rollout?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DK: Working very closely with all teams involved with these areas at the College Board, the SAT Committee will continue to provide the expertise and counsel that it has since the redesign was announced last year and thus will provide the continuity of knowledge and support that we believe will be especially pivotal over the next two years and beyond. At our meetings, and via email updates and conference calls, there is always a concurrent focus on several concerns — on the redesigned assessments themselves, on how the latest information and components are being shared out to our members, and on the support needed for smooth implementation. Having day-to-day practitioners from diverse K–12 and higher ed institutions on the committee allows us to ensure all perspectives and considerations are addressed by the College Board teams most directly working on these areas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: Talk a little bit about the shift that members will see to the PSAT&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; 8/9 and PSAT/NMSQT. What’s different about the PSAT/NMSQT? What will remain the same?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DK: The redesigned PSAT/NMSQT will be aligned with the redesigned SAT and will launch in October 2015. Like the SAT, the redesigned PSAT/NMSQT will measure the skills and knowledge that are essential for college readiness and success. Here are some of the key changes students will encounter on the redesigned exams:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Relevant Words in Context&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Command of Evidence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Essay analyzing a source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Focus on Math That Matters Most&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Problems Grounded in Real-World Contexts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analysis in Science and in History/Social Studies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Founding Documents and Great Global Conversation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Penalty for Wrong Answers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AA: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some opportunities for members to engage with the committee, or the College Board in general, throughout the implementation process? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DK: First off, I would encourage all members to learn more about the specific changes on the SAT redesign, along with available supporting materials at the College Board’s dedicated &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/about&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;website&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for the redesign.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knowing that both the SAT Committee and Higher Education Working Group are made up of representatives from both K–12 and higher ed, I encourage everyone to seek out those members you might know to provide any thoughts, suggestions, and recommendations to best assist you and, most importantly, our students and families. Utilize the opportunities to engage College Board staff at many of the events sponsored by the College Board such as regional and national forums, as well as those sponsored by other organizations where College Board staff is in attendance.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remember, the College Board is a membership-driven organization and its goal is to support members in their collective service to students and their families.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;SAT Committee Chair Donald Kamentz Gears up for 2015 and the Redesigned SAT&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

As former head counselor in Georgia’s DeKalb County Schools, I saw 95 percent of my advisees go to college, so I know the difference early college planning can make. It allows students to break the application process into manageable chunks and eliminates the pressure of having to do everything all at once. Even if students make progress on only one or two of the tasks below, they’ll be ahead of the curve when school starts in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research colleges.&lt;/strong&gt; With no papers to write or projects to complete, summer is an ideal time for students to start thinking about what they want in a college and then find schools that fit the bill. The Internet makes it easy to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/college-search&quot;&gt;research colleges&lt;/a&gt; with free online resources students can use to learn which schools have the traits they’re looking for. The College Board offers a number of these free resources on BigFuture.org, including a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/find-colleges/how-to-find-your-college-fit/quick-guide-starting-your-college-search&quot;&gt;step-by-step guide&lt;/a&gt; to help students get started.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit colleges.&lt;/strong&gt; For students who aren’t sure what type of college would fit them best, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/find-colleges/campus-visit-guide&quot;&gt;visiting college campuses&lt;/a&gt; can help them figure it out. It isn’t necessary to spend a lot of time or money on travel; visiting an array of nearby colleges — small, large, public, private, urban, rural — allows students to discover which attributes are most important to them and which schools to apply to.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start a college list&lt;/strong&gt;. I recommend that students make a list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/get-in/applying&quot;&gt;at least four colleges&lt;/a&gt; to which they plan to apply. The College Board provides four &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/get-in/applying-101/college-application-fee-waivers&quot;&gt;college application fee waivers&lt;/a&gt; to all eligible seniors to eliminate the financial barrier of application fees. When students apply to four or more colleges, they increase their chances of enrolling in a college that is a good academic, social, and financial fit. Applying to four or more colleges also allows students to compare financial aid packages if they get into more than one school, which may be the deciding factor when choosing between otherwise similar colleges.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare for college entrance exams.&lt;/strong&gt; Before applying to any school, however, it’s a good idea to take a college entrance exam like the SAT®. Most colleges and universities require SAT or other entrance exam scores as part of their application process — and even schools that don’t require these scores consider them when making admission decisions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most high school seniors will have already taken a college entrance exam, but those who haven’t can take the current version of the SAT through January 2016. Incoming high school juniors should plan to take the &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/psat-nmsqt-psat-10&quot;&gt;redesigned PSAT/NMSQT®&lt;/a&gt; in October and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;new SAT&lt;/a&gt; in March 2016. Taking the PSAT/NMSQT is excellent practice for the first administration of the new SAT, and it puts students in the running for millions of dollars’ worth of &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/psat-nmsqt-psat-10/scholarships-and-recognition&quot;&gt;scholarships&lt;/a&gt;. Ambitious students can use the summer to get a head start on preparing for the new SAT by reading about its &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/about/key-features&quot;&gt;key changes&lt;/a&gt; and signing up for free, online, personalized SAT practice at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot;&gt;Khan Academy&lt;/a&gt;. The Official SAT Practice at KhanAcademy.org reinforces the skills and knowledge taught in classrooms around the country, which are the same skills and knowledge needed to be successful in college and career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer is a time to relax and have fun, but I urge you to advise the college-bound students in your life to also spend some time planning for college. As little as two hours a week researching schools and practicing for entrance exams is all it takes for students to start the school year off right and take charge of their future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Use The Summer Wisely: Start Planning For College&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The start of the school year is an exciting albeit busy time for many high school students and their families. Classes begin, extracurricular activities start up and college planning kicks into high gear. Whether students are taking on challenging course work, practicing for the SAT or creating a game plan for life after high school, a new school year is a great time to think about the future and set achievable goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, planning for college and beyond can sometimes be daunting — logistically as well as financially. &lt;/span&gt;As executive director of college planning at the College Board, I’m often asked how students and families can save time and money in preparing for college. My first piece of advice is always to talk to a school counselor, teacher or principal about starting the college search process. I then encourage students to take advantage of the many free tools and resources available to help them find, apply to and enroll in colleges that are a good fit for them academically and financially, and that meet their personal criteria (for example: close to home, diverse student body, highly regarded biology program).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Free Online College Planning Tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 56, 145);&quot; title=&quot;bigfuture.org&quot;&gt;bigfuture.org&lt;/a&gt;, the College Board’s free college planning resource, students can access easy-to-use tools to search for colleges, explore majors and careers, and make a step-by-step college plan based on their grade level and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students and families can also find &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/pay-for-college/tools-calculators&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 56, 145);&quot;&gt;tools and calculators&lt;/a&gt; to help estimate what it will cost to attend individual colleges, compare financial aid packages and get an idea of how much they should plan to save for college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inread ng-isolate-scope inread-active&quot; id=&quot;article-0-inread&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: &#039;Times New Roman&#039;; font-size: 21px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 21px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. College Application and Test Fee Waivers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every student who takes the SAT or an SAT Subject Test using a fee waiver will automatically receive four &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/get-in/applying-101/college-application-fee-waivers&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 56, 145);&quot;&gt;college application fee waivers&lt;/a&gt; directly from the College Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students should talk to their counselors to find out if they qualify for &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/register/fees/fee-waivers&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 56, 145);&quot;&gt;SAT fee waivers&lt;/a&gt;, then check out the colleges and universities that accept application fee waivers. (Hint: There are thousands.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Personalized Practice Tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board and Khan Academy have teamed up to offer high-quality, personalized practice for the new SAT — absolutely free for every student and available online 24/7. The new SAT more closely reflects what’s being taught in classrooms across the country, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/sat&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 56, 145);&quot;&gt;Official SAT Practice&lt;/a&gt; is also an excellent tool to help enhance students’ performance in their high school courses as well as on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/psat-nmsqt-psat-10&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 56, 145);&quot;&gt;new PSAT/NMSQT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At khanacademy.org, students will become familiar with the content and format of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/inside-the-test/key-features&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 56, 145);&quot;&gt;new SAT&lt;/a&gt; by accessing thousands of sample SAT questions and having the opportunity to take four official full-length practice tests. The instant feedback students receive will let them know the areas in which they excel and in which they could improve. Khan Academy then provides a unique practice plan based on each student’s performance to help build the skills they need to succeed in college and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students taking the current SAT now through Jan. 23, 2016, can also find Khan Academy resources to help them prepare for the test, as well as many free practice resources from the College Board, including a full-length SAT practice test and the SAT Question of the Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inread ng-isolate-scope inread-active&quot; id=&quot;article-0-inread&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: &#039;Times New Roman&#039;; font-size: 21px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 21px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Scholarships Connected to Assessments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sophomores and juniors should talk to their school counselors about taking the new PSAT/NMSQT on Oct. 14. By taking the PSAT/NMSQT, students get practice for the new SAT&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; and juniors may become eligible for the National Merit Scholarship Program, the National Hispanic Recognition Program and other programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College Board has also recently forged new partnerships with &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/about/benefits/scholarships-recognition&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 56, 145);&quot;&gt;scholarship providers&lt;/a&gt;, increasing access to nearly $180 million in combined annual awards for low-income and underrepresented students taking the PSAT/NMSQT. Sophomores taking the new PSAT 10 will be eligible for these new scholarship opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students can find additional scholarship opportunities using the College Board’s free &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/scholarship-search&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 56, 145);&quot;&gt;Scholarship Search&lt;/a&gt; tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Free Tools For Back To School&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Similar scenarios have been playing out across the country as the College Board works to make sure that the people who are guiding our students through the college planning process have the latest, most accurate information and resources available on our redesigned assessments, financial aid, and college advising in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the workshop, a quick participant poll taken via smartphone revealed that only 44 percent of counselors in attendance felt “somewhat” or “very” comfortable talking about the changes to the redesigned SAT and PSAT/NMSQT. This prompted a discussion of the eight key changes to the SAT and how the PSAT 8/9 provides a baseline measurement of skills so teachers can monitor a student’s progress. Details on the new interactive score reporting portal were also shared as Shameek fielded questions from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than one question had to do with the costs associated with applying to college. One counselor asked if the College Board had ever considered offering fee waivers for the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE instead of for college applications – because many colleges already waive those fees.  This gave Shameek the opportunity to reveal an exciting new development: “Every student who uses an SAT fee waiver automatically gets a PROFILE fee waiver” beginning in the 2016-17 school year. The counselors responded with a hearty round of applause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked what she thought of the workshop, Margaret Ellis, a counselor at Cardinal Spellman High School in the Bronx, said, “I really enjoyed it. I feel much more informed, and I’m happy to have materials I can take back and share with my colleagues.” She also said that some of her students had already taken a redesigned SAT practice test and were particularly happy with one of the changes. “They really liked the reading passages,” she said, because they were more interesting and relevant than her students were expecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Cantor, a former teacher and counselor who now works as an administrator for New York’s Public School Athletic League, has attended the workshops for over 10 years. “I always find the information valuable,” he said. “The presenters are very good — very knowledgeable.” He then shared his favorite part about the redesigned SAT: “I think getting rid of the calculator for part of the test is excellent. I was a math teacher in the 80s and 90s, and I wouldn’t let my students bring a calculator into the classroom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of his presentation, Shameek once again administered that same poll — but the results had changed. Now, 97 percent of attendees were somewhat or very comfortable in their knowledge of the redesigned SAT. Looking relieved but not at all surprised, Shameek thanked the attendees for coming and wished them a successful school year.&lt;/p&gt;

The app is available for free in the Apple and Google Play stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app guides students through the essential steps they need to take in order to find, apply to, and attend the right college for them. The interactive, step-by-step platform uses game, video, and search features to help students plan their college journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CollegeGo is aimed at supporting underserved students who may lack the resources to help them find the right college for them. But all students can benefit from this guided mobile experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students can log in to CollegeGo via their College Board account and seamlessly connect their information to BigFuture. Among the benefits: students can save a college to their list on CollegeGo and view their updated list when they login later to BigFuture.&lt;/p&gt;

But there’s another College Board program that deserves some attention: the Upward Bound program in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last 17 years, the College Board has been hosting 110 students —75 percent low income, 100 percent African American — in Upward Bound, its four-year college planning program. Students from Anacostia, Ballou, and HD Woodson high schools participate in an intensive summer program and weekly tutoring to help them stay on track for college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To see students’ eyes widen with amazement when they first step on a college campus, travel to other states for college tours, explore career opportunities they never knew existed, and participate in cultural activities, is a heartwarming experience,” said Marlene Guy, director of the Upward Bound Program. “Knowing that we are providing youth with opportunities that they might not otherwise have without Upward Bound continues to reaffirm my purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, an average of 79 percent of students who consistently participated in the Upward Bound program went to college in the fall immediately following their high school graduation. The same could be said for only 45.5 percent of low-income students nationally, and 51.9 percent of students in D.C. schools (both public and private). Upward Bound’s six-year college graduation rate for the classes of 2006 and 2007 was 46 percent, which is on par with the national average for low-income, underrepresented students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those college-going students is Mariah Green, valedictorian of her class at HD Woodson High School, who graduated from the program and got into her dream school, Temple University. As part of the program, she was able to visit more than 20 colleges and find out which would be the best fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Upward Bound helped me with essay-writing and presentation skills,” said Mariah. “I believe I wouldn’t have had the confidence to apply to the colleges I did if it wasn’t for the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upward Bound focuses on academic-skill enhancement and social development through after-school and Saturday academies. Students also attend rigorous six-week summer classes, individual and group college planning, career enrichment experiences, and cultural experiential excursions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students are referred by DCPS and complete an application. Each year, the program receives an average of 70 applications for about 20–25 spots for ninth- and 10th-graders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mariah says the program taught her what to expect in college and how to search for scholarships — a skill that has really paid off. She’ll be attending Temple this fall with the help of two scholarships and has very little to pay out of pocket. She hopes to go into the sports and wellness field and major in kinesiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am so happy I got into Upward Bound! I feel I’m prepared, and I know there are resources to help me succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Upward Bound Shows D.C.

    <title>Leap (a School) Year</title>

&lt;p&gt;Outside a small cabin in Viareggio, Italy, is the sound of the Ligurian Sea dancing around the littoral rocks, while inside you are enjoying the breakfast of a nice, warm, buttery jam-filled cornetti, accompanied by a steaming cup of Italian coffee. With open windows, you enjoy the breeze from the coast and the smell of a rich culture. Mmmm…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few months ago you were accepted into that college you were dying to get into. And, like Florida weather, you haphazardly changed your mind and decided to instead defer and take a gap year before attending. Good or bad decision?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students take a gap year for many different reasons. The months before college can be the perfect time for students to experience a different culture, learn a new language, volunteer for a cause they feel strongly about, or possibly explore their career interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gap experience, which can be as short as a few months or as long as a year, is pretty commonplace in areas such as Europe and Australia, but not so much in the U.S. While it has become something of a recent fad in the states, students often still get that queasy stomach feeling and a lump in their throats when trying to decide if taking a gap year is the best decision for their future. Can you blame them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think back to when you were in high school, to the struggles you may have faced. High school is a stressful time. You spend four long years trying to be the best, then months in the tedious and befuddling process of completing college applications and financial aid information (and let’s not forget the crying that goes along with this). Then, you finally get accepted — only to push it off for a year? Makes no sense, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As Americans, we’ve become conditioned to understand our pathway as completing high school, attending college &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; after, and then finding a great paying job. While for some students taking a detour from college could mean falling off the education wagon completely, a gap year goes a long way to ensuring some students recognize that there is a life after high school that is not college. Sometimes, it’s nice to get away from the academic grind and take a break.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://americangap.org/data-benefits.php&quot;&gt;American Gap Association&lt;/a&gt;, 90 percent of students who take a gap year attend or returned to college within a year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many people think only students from wealthy families can take advantage of  a gap year. In fact, there are many organizations, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.carpemundi.org/&quot;&gt;Carpe Mundi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalcitizenyear.org/&quot;&gt;Global Citizen Year&lt;/a&gt;, that offer full or partial scholarships and other financial aid to high school graduates. These organizations offer the chance to participate in work-related educational travel and other programs during a gap year so that students can learn through cultural immersion and exploration. Anecdotal evidence often shows that we develop most when the world around us changes, because our understanding of ourselves also changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taking a gap year encourages students to get out of their comfort zone, because this is the perfect time to test their limits, meet different people, and immerse themselves in completely different cultures. It is a time to take chances and to make mistakes. Many students enter college because they are comfortable with the idea of college. They fail to realize that just because something is uncomfortable doesn’t mean that they can’t do it. They just haven’t taken the time to explore that option yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider using a gap year as an opportunity to “deschool” but &lt;em&gt;rediscover &lt;/em&gt;learning. So much of the school experience is encased in a room surrounded by four walls and a few windows, while someone lectures you on the Principles of Modern Urodynamic studies, Regiomontanus&#039; Angle Maximization problem, Solubility and Electrochemistry, or even English 101. A gap year can help students go beyond those walls, figure out their place in the world, and see how they are only a small part of something much larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My message to students: A gap year gives you the chance to smoothly transition between two different life phases, while at the same time trying to figure out who you are, what you want to accomplish, and what you next step(s) in life will be. It’s a time to reflect and take a deep breath and realize all of your hard work. It’s a time for self-actualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you’re wondering if I took a gap year. Actually, I didn’t. Looking back on it, I don’t regret it either. At that time, I only had one thing on my mind, and that was to finish what I started. The pressure from my family and friends and everyone who supported me was too much to bear. To me, a gap year seemed like an easy “out.” I didn’t want to be like the people I saw when I walked to school every morning. There was a fire inside me that just made my desire to continue through college, burn more and more —with an increasing, yet positive, ferocity. I welcomed every challenge and minor setback with open arms, because in the end, I learned who I was and what I was capable of. I found myself — even without the benefit of a gap year. &lt;/p&gt;
