&lt;p&gt;“Do a little bit more,” Kauffman said. “It will change not only the lives of the young people you work with and for, but it will change your own life, too.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kauffman told the story of her own childhood. When she was very young, her parents moved the family from an Indian reservation to the public housing projects of Seattle, where Kauffman and her six siblings were often left alone to take care of themselves. One day, in third grade, Kauffman arrived at school late. When she entered the classroom, her teacher immediately took her hand and led her to the restroom. There, the teacher, Mrs. Huntington, washed Kauffman’s face, combed her hair, and helped her to correctly button her dress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Here was an adult helping me,” Kauffman said. “Mrs. Huntington didn’t have to wash my face, comb my hair, and button my dress — but she was doing a little bit more.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Throughout my life,” she continued, “there have been people who have helped me along the way, people who did more than they had to do. Because of them, I was able to achieve the successes I did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After she finished her talk, Kauffman took questions from the audience. A student asked her, “What is your definition of success?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kauffman paused a moment. “Right now,” she said, “it’s to be authentic and tell the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Doing ‘a Little Bit More’ Can Mean a Lot&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Maria Adams Davidson of Montgomery College began by speaking about the unique situation of community colleges, like her own, which enroll substantial numbers of first-generation students. Among Montgomery’s initiatives to support these students is its data-driven Student Success Score Card, a set of indicators that tracks academic achievement and then provides actionable information to improve individual student outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khristina Gonzalez, from Princeton University, talked about her school’s Freshman Scholars Institute, a seven-week summer program that gives 80 incoming students, many of whom are the first in their families to go to college, the opportunity to experience the intellectual and social life of college before the fall semester begins. Kevin Hudson, also from Princeton, noted that the Freshman Scholars Institute and a number of other initiatives at the university seek to answer the same core question: “How do high-achieving, low-income or first-generation college students develop the social capital and cultural capital required to thrive?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tevera Stith, who runs the KIPP Through College program for KIPP DC, a network of high-performing Washington charter schools, emphasized the importance of focusing on college completion at all levels of education. “At KIPP schools,” Stith said, “what it takes to get a student through college is everybody’s business.” It’s not enough, she continued, to celebrate when a first-generation student is accepted to college — it’s important to remain engaged with such students, and to help and encourage them to finish what they’ve started. “We have it written all over the walls at our schools,” she said. “Finish, finish, finish.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Addressing the Needs of First-Generation Students&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>New Automated Writing Tool Opens Worlds of Possibility for SpringBoard Students, Teachers</title>

Yes — but only if there&#039;s a human hand to help guide it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a major takeaway from &quot;Beyond the Red Pen: Automated Writing Evaluation Tools,&quot; a Thursday morning session at the 2016 Northeastern Regional Forum in Boston. Led by Doug Waugh, executive director of SpringBoard Product Management, and Tim Marks, senior program manager for the College Board&#039;s Automated Essay Evaluation Program, the session provided an in-depth look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://turnitin.com/en_us/what-we-offer/revision-assistant&quot;&gt;Revision Assistant&lt;/a&gt;, a new offering from &lt;a href=&quot;http://turnitin.com/&quot;&gt;Turnitin&lt;/a&gt; that provides student writers with constant feedback and suggestions about how they can improve their work through meaningful practice and revision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&#039;s not science fiction,&quot; Marks said of the futuristic-sounding technology, which is currently available for use in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://springboard.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;English Language Arts curriculum of SpringBoard&lt;/a&gt;. The tool is able to support students and teachers because of all the developmental work that goes on at the front end of the process. “Grounding everything in the human process is key to what we do,” Marks said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revision Assistant works on an algorithm similar to those used by Pandora and Netflix to build their customer recommendations and is informed by teacher input every step of the way. SpringBoard teachers participate in group evaluation and scoring sessions of student essays — much like the AP Readings — to provide the tool with a blueprint from which it begins to learn and recognize the hallmarks of good writing. Teachers also help build the prompts, rubrics, and scoring criteria that are incorporated into Revision Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpringBoard teachers are encouraged to share the prompts and scoring criteria with their students before they begin writing to help them better understand the goals and expectations of a performance task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The transparency gained from previewing the assignment can help students really get a sense of what they can and need to do to score well,” Waugh said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As students being drafting their essays, Revision Assistant generates feedback by comparing traits from their current assignment against those in previously scored essays, which allows the tool to notice trends in a given student’s use of language, essay structure, and expression of ideas. The feedback comments are displayed in pop-up windows alongside the students’ essays, so they can adjust in real time as they compose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://i1054.photobucket.com/albums/s490/uvasig/NERO%20session%20-%20teacher%20scoring_zpsm9hqagwj.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height:300px; width:400px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Session attendees engage in an essay-scoring demonstration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Revision Assistant gives students a large degree of autonomy on what do with that feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The display comments offer suggestions,” Marks said. “How to improve is left to the student; the feedback is designed to help them think through the writing process. When [an essay] gets to a teacher, the idea is that a student will have considered the elements needed to produce a good essay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waugh said that SpringBoard teachers and students are enjoying the benefits of Revision Assistant. Because the tool allows for the unlimited submission of drafts, students can engage in thoughtful practice that gives them constant feedback on their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They like to lean over and see their classmates’ signal checks to see how they’re doing,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For teachers, Revision Assistant helps them see the progression of their students’ writing over time, which can help them track improvement and offer more targeted coaching during one-on-one editing sessions. They also have the opportunity to grow professionally as graders by participating in the group scoring and norming sessions with other educators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These resources come from the Coalition for Access, Affordability, and Success (CAAS), a diverse group of 90+ colleges and universities that are committed to providing college access to students of all backgrounds. Growing &lt;a href=&quot;http://research.collegeboard.org/PUBLICATIONS/REVIEW-ROLE-COLLEGE-APPLICATIONS-STUDENTS-POSTSECONDARY-OUTCOMES&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;has shown that students from disadvantaged backgrounds especially struggle with the college planning and application process, often missing out on the opportunities they deserve. The group is committed to leveling the playing field by guiding students through every step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re providing tools and organization for students and schools that don’t currently have them,” said Will Herald, senior assistant director of admissions at the University of Chicago, who presented alongside Heidi Meyer, director of transfer admissions at the University of Minnesota–Twin Cities, at this year’s Midwestern Regional Forum. Herald and Meyer gave counselors, teachers, and higher education professionals an early look at three of the forthcoming platforms: the College Locker, the Collaboration Platform, and the Application Portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The college planning process starts with the College Locker, which will launch in April 2016. It will serve as a repository for a student’s “proudest moments and best work,” said Herald. Submissions might include graded analytic essays, videos of performances or robotics competitions, or photos from notable service projects.  Students can begin filling their “lockers” as early as they’d like, and can update and refine them at will.  At no point in the process will colleges be able to access this space, thereby giving students the freedom and flexibility to experiment with how they want to represent themselves and their accomplishments. And as they decide which of these materials they want to submit as part of their college applications, they can share these files with counselors and other trusted adults; the Collaboration Portal will provide a dedicated digital space for these exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in July 2016, high school seniors will also be able to access the Application Portal. Here they can maintain a detailed list of the colleges they’re interested in, see the admission requirements of each school, and submit application materials. Meanwhile, their high school counselors can monitor their progress electronically and use the platform to send transcripts and letters of recommendation to schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A counselor who attended the session was hopeful that this tool could help her and her primarily low-income and underrepresented students, but she wondered how it would address affordability; students are unlikely to plan for college, she said, if they don’t think they can afford to go in the first place. Herald was happy to announce that, over the next year, the CAAS will work with financial aid experts and school counselors to create more supports associated with applying for financial aid and scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;

The College Board’s Aaron Lemon-Strauss delivered this good news at the Midwestern Regional Forum, then passed the mic to two educators who’ve found innovative ways to encourage SAT practice in their own communities: Maria Salinas, site coordinator at University of Michigan-Flint’s Neff Center, and Mark Lomax, senior director of teen programming at the Boys and Girls Clubs of Columbus, Ohio (BGCC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salinas works in the Beecher Community School District, a rural area that serves about 1,000 students, 95 percent of whom qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. Partnering with GEAR UP Michigan, University of Michigan-Flint, and other local educators and organizations, she focuses primarily on helping 11th-graders prepare for the unique pressures and demands of the 12th grade and beyond. “All of our organizations work and learn together,” she said, emphasizing the power of groups uniting to ensure student success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Michigan began offering the SAT to all students, Salinas and her colleagues have started a number of initiatives to help students prepare for the test. Every junior in the district attends an SAT prep course during the “sixth hour” of their school day; three teachers lead these courses, with the support of a rotating group of University of Michigan students.  In October 2015, they also organized their first SAT Boot Camp, a four-day event created to motivate students to prepare for the SAT, familiarize them with Khan Academy’s practice resources, and reward them (with a pizza party and game night) for taking initiative. Salinas and her team are piloting a two-day version of this boot camp later in February, and hope to support more students with increased one-on-one tutoring and focused SAT practice time during study halls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over at the BGCC, Lomax has been thinking about how to use students’ out-of-school time to help them prepare for their future. In his communities, students suffer from low expectations, he explained — 65 percent of their parents did not graduate from high school and 95 percent are un- or underemployed. Because most of these students feel pressure to support their families, Lomax realized he may be able to increase participation in academic programs by providing a financial incentive. He asked his students to attend four three-hour SAT practice sessions (using Khan Academy) on Saturday mornings in exchange for summer job placement at a site that paid at least $10 an hour.  Thirty students signed up; of the students who had previously taken the SAT, 80 percent reported improved scores after these sessions. All 30 were placed in a summer job.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lomax also worked with local schools to ensure that the transition from using Khan Academy at school to using it at the Boys and Girls Clubs was seamless, and he instituted “power hour” tutoring sessions, during which students use Khan Academy resources to build foundation skills in reading and math. To continue this momentum, he plans to hold additional trainings for staff and volunteers, streamline implementation at all 10 local Boys and Girls Clubs so students can move easily from center to center, and encourage all students with smartphones to download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/practice/daily-practice-app&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SAT practice app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about one thing all educators could do now to support SAT practice, both Salinas and Lomax agreed: “When they say they don’t have homework, always get them on Khan Academy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see more tips for using Khan Academy resources in your own setting, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/k12-educators/advising-instruction/practice-resources&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;satpractice.org/k12&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;How Educators are Using Khan Academy in the Midwest — and Seeing Results &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

From applying to college to navigating the financial aid process to completing summer paperwork, it can be difficult for students to manage all the pieces along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange County Public Schools is making that process easier by providing a college transition counselor at each high school. At the College Board’s Southern Regional Forum, two of these counselors, Heather Alexander and Latashia Joseph, shared how their work has helped the students and parents of Orange County on their way to college, and offered advice based on the lessons they’ve learned over the past year and a half of the college transition program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicate widely:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s important to reach students where they are. Each high school has a college and career center where students can come for information and resources. In addition to in-person outreach, the college transition counselors connect with students via social media, the Edmodo global education network, school newsletters, and websites. They also use Remind, a communication tool to help teachers and counselors reach students and parents via text.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reach out to parents and families:&lt;/strong&gt; Parents are a critical part of the college planning process. Offering opportunities for parents to learn about the college application process, financial aid, and more can help them to be an active participant in the process. One of the ways that the college transition counselors reach parents is through their Parent Academy, a monthly program held on Saturdays for parents of students at all grade levels. The academy provides a comprehensive look at key components of applying to college, searching for financial aid, and transitioning to college.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide motivation and celebrate successes:&lt;/strong&gt; Completing each step on the journey to college should be recognized. One of the ways the college transition counselors motivate and celebrate their students is through “college signing days” once students have decided which college they’ll attend. Modeled after similar events for high school athletes planning to play at the college level, each school has their students sign a “letter of intent” to their future college, celebrate their college decision, and encourage their postsecondary plans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acceptance isn’t the finish line:&lt;/strong&gt; Once students have accepted an offer to attend college, their work isn’t done. Orange County Public Schools college transition counselors work to combat what is commonly referred to as “summer melt” by breaking down informational barriers for students and families, partnering with local institutions, and encouraging students to participate in summer bridge programs. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Southern Regional Forum: 4 Ways to Bridge the Gap Between High School and College&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Support from parents, school counselors, and other caring adults has kept them on track in their education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I honestly thought college was something that was out of reach to me,” Johnathan said, noting that having people motivate him has helped him reach his full potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnathan, Kharis, and Anthony all cited advanced course work as a critical part of their education that has helped them prepare for college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel academically ready for college,” said Anthony, adding that this is chiefly because of his advanced course work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a college student, Johnathan credited his AP classes with making him feel comfortable in a college classroom. “Being able to take those classes and see what a college class is really like let me challenge myself,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If more people were exposed to the kind of work and the rigor of these classes — that would get us more ready academically,” Kharis added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As high school seniors, Kharis and Anthony are excited about what’s ahead of them. However, they also know there are skills they’ll need to develop once they get to campus, like managing their autonomy as young adults on their own for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you’re in college, you have to be really responsible for yourself,” Kharis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony added: “The biggest thing I’m worried about is cleaning my room.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The students ended the plenary by offering words of advice to younger students, as well as to the educators in the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re not doing something that’s making you worried, it’s not challenging you enough. And if it’s not challenging you enough, you aren’t using your full potential,” said Johnathan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kharis closed the session by imploring educators to push every student to do more: “I think if you give every student the opportunity — honestly, I feel like they would shock you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Student Voices: Learning from Those We Teach&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Arsallah Shairzay, Dean of Early College and Advanced Placement Program&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; at the Friendship Collegiate Academy in Washington, DC was presented the William U. Harris Award of Excellence. This award recognizes an individual from a member institution who has demonstrated extraordinary leadership skills in the field of education, a record of service that has inspired, the ability to prepare and connect young people to college, and a genuine commitment to mentoring education leaders in an environment that supports their development and growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doranna Tindle, Principal of Friendship Tech Prep High School in Washington, DC presented the award to Arsallah and said, &quot;Dr. Shairzay’s work is the work of cultivating minds and changing lives for the better….the long and arduous task of leveling the playing field and getting marginalized and underserved students into and through college is gritty and difficult on the ground. Dr. Shairzay has done this work with unwavering passion and without asking for honor or adulation every single day for over a decade. I am happy to say that I am a product of Dr. Shairzay’s intentional development and I stand here as a mere representative of the hundreds of students, teachers, leaders, and parents he has invested in and developed over the years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bernard P. Ireland Recognition Award was presented to Rodney Morrison, Associate Provost for Enrollment and Retention Management at Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY.  The award recognizes an individual with a commitment to improving humanity through education, by demonstrating a record of service to young people in the easing of the transition from high school to college, and distinguishing themselves as a change agent in their constituency. It is the highest individual award that is given to Middle States Regional Assembly members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When asked about Rodney’s contributions to students, colleagues remember him as one of the enrollment professionals that truly puts long term student success as a priority” said David Adams, Vice President, Middle States Region, who presented the award. “He cares about outcomes and not just initial short term enrollment decisions, and is a strong advocate for providing students with the supports they need to be successful in higher education. Despite the confusing and overwhelming process of finding the right college, his compassionate personality puts families at ease. As students look back at their college years, they remember Rodney as a person who had a strong impact on them getting into, staying, and graduating from college”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These accolades were conferred on January 28, 2016, at the Middle States Regional Forum, held in Baltimore, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Education Leaders Honored at the Middle States Regional Forum &quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;“There is no greater work that we can do than to help young students get prepared to make meaningful change in the world,” said Youlanda Copeland-Morgan, the opening plenary speaker and vice provost for enrollment management at UCLA. “Education is at the core of equality and democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copleand-Morgan—who is a first-generation college graduate—noted that private colleges and universities are increasing outreach to underserved populations at a moment when many public institutions are faced with budgetary shortfalls brought about by legislative decisions. But she emphasized that even in the face of declining state support and a shifting policy environment, public universities must continue to do everything that they can to serve as engines of social mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These are times of challenge and controversy,” she said. “But I refuse to let the politics of America deter me from my responsibility to keep the door of education at my institution and in our communities open to those who can least advocate for themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her role at UCLA, Copeland-Morgan and her team have committed themselves to increasing diversity on campus across a number of metrics. She noted that the university’s most recent class included the largest number of African American and Latino students in the school’s history, the largest number of Native American enrollees since 1995, and a record-breaking number of low-income students (38% of the class was eligible to receive Pell grants). The LGBTQ and veteran communities at UCLA were also thriving, she said—all while UCLA ranked fourth nationally in four-year graduation rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The notion that we can’t have diversity without excellence is a false narrative,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copeland-Morgan then spoke about how a successful public K12 education system strengthens public universities in doing their job. “The ability of public schools to reach the masses and deliver social and economic mobility is key to the American dream,” she said. “Without the strong foundation provided by public middle and high schools, public universities can’t deliver on their promise of opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Copeland-Morgan, this is a moment for educators to rededicate themselves to their profession and its underlying values. “If we commit ourselves and our resources to creating educational opportunity for all, I have hope that despite the climate we see in Washington, we can muster the ingenuity of the willing in our nation to work to improve college education and increase education rates across all groups. We can deliver opportunity to all,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So my challenge to you is that you continue to be committed to making progress in your community, your school, your college, or your university. Do what you can do to advance educational equality in your communities. Share your successes with your colleagues. Challenge the College Board to keep making progress on the areas of concern to you. We have a responsibility to make a difference.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While noting that this work will at times be hard, Copeland-Morgan ended on a hopeful note by quoting the catchphrase of a politician who has just stepped from the scene. “Can we do this?” she said. “Yes, we can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Forum Plenary Stresses Importance of Public Education&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>Southern Regional Forum Closes with Panel of College Admission Officers</title>

The esteemed panel, with a combined 125 years of experience, featured:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Barbara Polk, deputy director of undergraduate admissions, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ingrid Hayes, vice president for enrollment management, Spelman College&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kerr C. Ramsay III, associate vice president for admissions, High Point University&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tim Amyx, director of admissions &amp;amp; registrar, Volunteer State Community College&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are some highlights from their conversation. Remarks have been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What do admissions officers look for during the review process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barbara Polk&lt;/strong&gt;: We want to get to know the students as individuals, as best we can. The tricky or challenging part is when you have to then take their stories, in some cases from various institutions, and put them into a competitive decision process. And that’s hard to do, because if it’s a holistic review, then you don’t just point to a GPA or a test score and say, ‘If you had 10 points higher here, or if you have GPA had been this instead of that…’ It’s the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Should students be worried about referencing personal stories in their essay?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingrid Hayes&lt;/strong&gt;: As long as the information they’re sharing helps us to understand their journey and their passion for what they do, that is absolutely something that they can share. That’s really what’s important—for students to give that extra coloring, to tell us why this thing was important, why that other thing was important, and to share it with the admission committee. We want to understand their stories. We all want to cheer for our students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Is experiential education a good way to get around the idea of mere “credit-counting”? Is it too difficult for students to take on, or for higher ed institutions to implement? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kerr C. Ramsay III&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s our responsibility to go beyond what we think students can do. I think experiential learning helps students get beyond “credit-counting” or just “information.” And I think we all know as educators that when you really understand something, you’re able to then teach it. That’s the best sign that you understand a concept, when you’re able to share it with someone else in a way that they can understand it. Imagine asking an athlete to only practice all the time and never play a game. We would never do that. But we ask our students to do that all the time in academics, and we think that it’s a bit of a faulty mindset. We need to give our students chance to try and apply their learning each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What other higher education options are out there for students?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim Amyx&lt;/strong&gt;: Let me encourage you to learn about the activity at your community colleges nearby. If you really care about your students, then sometimes you have to have the conversation when you say, “You know what? What you’re facing is overwhelming, and you might be better off taking a baby step, but that baby step doesn’t mean that it’s a bad step.” My biggest retention problem is that the students get to the community college and they find out that it’s hard, that we actually have academic rigor. So, if you’re at a four-year school or you’re K-12 counselors, I encourage you to take the time to find out about all of your students’ higher education options. You may find that there’s a hidden gem in your backyard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Southern Regional Forum Closes with Panel of College Admission Officers&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
