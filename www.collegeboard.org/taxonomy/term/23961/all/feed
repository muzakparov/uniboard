All former College Board trustees who wish to continue to collaborate with the organization are invited to be members of the Oak Circle. Gordon Stanley, Director of College Counseling at Webb School of Knoxville in Knoxville, Tennessee and founding Chair of the Oak Circle, says that the group was created to keep former trustees engaged with the College Board “so that their rich experiences could continue to be used productively, but differently, than when they served as trustees.” Gordon is pleased to now have over 40 former trustees as Oak Circle members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the group’s launch in 2013, Oak Circle members have served as program planning committee members for College Board events, presented during the Enrollment Leadership Academy, served on committees for College Board’s recognition programs, and recently were assigned as mentors to the winners of the College Board’s new Fellowship Program. Gordon also touts   the Oak Circle’s participation in hosting the New Attendee Welcome session at the College Board &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.collegeboard.org/&quot;&gt;National Forum&lt;/a&gt; for the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this year’s Forum, Gordon will be cycling off as Chair of the Oak Circle, handing the post over to Leo Munson, Associate Provost at Texas Christian University. Leo has served on the Oak Circle Advisory Committee for the past three years and has a strong passion for the work that the Oak Circle leads. Upon reflection of his time on the Advisory, Leo shares, “It is not often that friends and colleagues are asked to create a mission and vision for a new organization. I am pleased that I played a small part in assembling former trustees who have played such a large part in the College Board’s past and are interested in continuing their leadership and involvement going into the future.” As for his hopes for the Oak Circle’s future, Leo plans to build on Gordon’s exceptional leadership with a singular goal:  “To provide an open line of communication between executive leadership and those who have been part of the Board’s historic governance. It is my intent that participation in the Oak Circle will be meaningful to both the Board and the volunteer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oak Circle is grateful for Gordon’s fantastic leadership as we look forward to the future growth that Munson will guide the Oak Circle in. Congratulations to a great start, Oak Circle, and to the two exceptional leaders who will continue to shape the group’s success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Celebrating the College Board’s Oak Circle&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
